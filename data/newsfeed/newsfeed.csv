2019-12-17,Saniel,,,@Faber … Yes. I have a… research question that I’d like another perspective on.
2019-12-17,Faber,,,@Saniel any time! hope the subject is something I can help with
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,@Faber I hope so. The subject is… personal in nature.
2019-12-17,Faber,,,"@Saniel personal? like, related to your previous research?"
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,"@Faber … Er, no. Personal. As in, relating to aspects of my personal life. I’m asking for this advice in a strictly non-professional capacity."
2019-12-17,Faber,,,@Saniel want to make sure I got all this right
2019-12-17,Faber,,,@Saniel you want my opinion on a personal question
2019-12-17,Faber,,,@Sanilel about your personal life?
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,@Faber Yes.
2019-12-17,Faber,,,"@Saniel saniel rowe, are you asking me for dating advice???"
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,@Faber NO!
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,@Faber …That’s not strictly correct. I need advice on a gift.
2019-12-17,Faber,,,@Saniel a gift?
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,"@Faber It’s the holidays very soon, Faber. Traditionally, the holidays are when close friends and family exchange gifts, to promote goodwill and happiness in the coming year... (1/5)"

2019-12-17,Saniel,,,@Faber Well. Apologies. I’m rambling.
2019-12-17,Faber,,,"@Saniel nah man I get you, it’s a tough decision. who’s the present for?"
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,"@Faber Well, she’s a very… formidable woman. Quite intelligent. Very driven. She has a mischievous streak, definitely. I was thinking that she might appreciate a bound edition of the last 5 issues of The Journal Of Computational Linguistics – very handy."
2019-12-17,Faber,,,"@Saniel uh, please don’t take this the wrong way, but that’s a terrible present."
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,@Faber What? How could that be so terrible? It’s a massively important journal for the field!
2019-12-17,Faber,,,"@Saniel totally, I know it is, but that present is from your outside. that’s the Saniel you show everyone. gifts should be from your heart, from the part you don’t show most people, that’s what makes them special!"
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,"@Faber I… don’t quite see, but I think I get what you’re driving at. The gift should be… unexpected?"
2019-12-17,Faber,,,"@Saniel sort of, yeah, like in a way that shows you’re really paying attention to that person and what they like."
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,@Faber Hm. Then perhaps… Yes. I have an idea.
2019-12-17,Faber,,,@Saniel nice
2019-12-17,Faber,,,"@Saniel what’s cooking up there, dude?"
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,@Faber I have decided. I assume you know of the Voyager probes?
2019-12-17,Faber,,,@Saniel definitely. tiny little bits of hardware sailing off into the deep black… some seriously good engineering on those things.
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,"@Faber Yes, well, you know there was a golden record attached to one of those probes – it contained greetings, music, and messages that tried to represent as much of Earth’s culture as possible. I’m going to create a copy. That will be my gift."
2019-12-17,Faber,,,"@Saniel awesome! that’s more like it, something unexpected, from the heart. great present!"
2019-12-17,Saniel,,,"@Faber Thank you, Faber, for your help."
2019-12-17,Faber,,,"@Saniel anytime. you already knew what to do, though. trust your feelings, doc, you’ve got a good heart."
