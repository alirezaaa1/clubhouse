BOOTQUEST_QUEST_NAME,Bootstrapping your way to faster websites,,,,
BOOTQUEST_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
BOOTQUEST_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn to use Bootstrap, one of the fastest and most popular web libraries out there!",,,,
BOOTQUEST_1,"Hiya, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! You've been doing some great website work so far - but I'm sure you've wondered if there was a <b>really</b> fast way to build a website.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_2,"Well, there is! There's lots of code out there in these big collections called <b>libraries</b> - grab one of those, and you've got a ton of basic (and sometimes advanced!) functions and pieces already figured out for you. ",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_3,"<b>Bootstrap</b> is one of the most popular <b>libraries</b> out there, and since the code has all been used and reused thousands of times, it has barely any bugs. That's a big weight off your shoulders!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_4,"Let's jump right into creating a website with Bootstrap. If your browser doesn't open, click on the following link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://codepen.io/Hack-Computer/pen/ExamVOm</span></u>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_5,"You might recognize CodePen from some of your previous activities in the Web Pathway. This time, though, we're starting with a (relatively) blank canvas.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_6,"If you look at the <b>CSS</b> and <b>JS</b> panes, you can click the <b>gear</b> icon at the top of each of those panes to see that we've already <b>imported</b> some code for you. This is how you use a library - you <b>import</b> it. It's like referring to a character that was introduced earlier on in a book series. ""If you want to know more about Jeff, read the previous book."" By the way, you can move the box you are reading this text by placing your mouse over it and clicking the arrow at the top.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_7,"In that same way, all the bits that make up <b>Bootstrap</b> are referred to in the library we <b>imported</b>, and you can just refer to them and have them work.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_8,"This lets <b>Bootstrap</b> do all the heavy lifting, which frees you up to concentrate on the overall design of the website.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_9,"Let's take a look at the Bootstrap components you'll be using for the project. I'll launch another tab on your browser. If another tab doesn't appear, click on the following link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/</span></u>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_10,"These <b>Components</b> are all included in <b>Bootstrap</b>, all you have to do is reference them, and they'll show up in their full glory, like the heroic ranger the author introduced 5 chapters ago that rides in to save the day!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_11,"Let's add a <b>Carousel</b> to your page - lots of websites have these, it's that big image at the top that changes every so often. Click on the <b>Carousel</b> link in the left-hand section of the page, then find the section called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">With controls</span></tt>. Just under the image, you’ll see a bit of code with a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Copy</span></tt> link at the top right corner.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_12,"Click the link to copy the code and paste it into line 11 of your Codepen. If you have a mouse connected, <b>right-click</b> and select <b>Paste</b>. On a Hack laptop, click the mousepad with two fingers and select <b>Paste</b> or press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">CTRL + V</span></tt>.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_13,"You won't notice a huge change because the carousel doesn't have any pictures to display, but we're about to fix that.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_14,"Find the first of the three <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img&gt;</span></tt> tags on line 14. To the right of img, you'll see src (or source). Replace the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">...</span></tt> next to src with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF""><u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/happycat1</span></u></span></tt>. You can leave everything else as it is. Don't forget to keep the quotation marks. :)",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_15,"When you're finished, the line should look like this: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img src=""<u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/happycat1</span></u>"" class=""d-block w-100"" alt=""...""&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_16,"Boom, the first card of the carousel will display your new image. Great job!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_17,"Now do the same thing for the other two <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img&gt;</span></tt> tags using <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF""><u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/catpicture1</span></u></span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF""><u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">http://bit.ly/gingie</span></u></span></tt> on lines 17 and 20.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_18,Awesome! Now your carousel will rotate through the three images.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_19,Let's try adding a <b>Jumbotron</b> component to your page - This component lets you show off a bit of text in a really big way!,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_20,"As before, look on the left side of the Bootstrap page and find the <b>Jumbotron</b> section. Click it, then scroll down in the main part of the page until you find the <b>Fluid Jumbotron</b>. ",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_21,"Click the <b>Copy</b> link at the top right corner and paste the code just under your carousel on line 32 of your Codepen. If you have a mouse connected, <b>right-click</b> and select <b>Paste</b>. On a Hack laptop, click the mousepad with two fingers and select <b>Paste</b> or press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">CTRL + V</span></tt>.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_22,"Awesome! If you did it correctly, you should see the Fluid Jumbotron block displayed just under your carousel. Cool, right?",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_23,Nice job on the <b>Jumbotron</b> and <b>Carousel</b>! Let's keep going and add some more information to your page in the form of some cards. Cards are a great way to provide a lot of information in a small space.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_24,"First, though, add an empty line between lines 37 and 38 of your CodePen. We'll need that space!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_25,"Head back to the Bootstrap library page, and find the <b>Card</b> section in the left pane. Click it, and then scroll down in the main part of the page until you find <b>Card decks</b> section. Grab that code by clicking the <b>Copy</b> button, and paste it into line 38.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_26,"Like the <b>Carousel</b>, it'll show up with broken images at first - don't worry, we'll fix that. Find the first <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">""...""</span></tt> section and replace it with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF""><u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/happycat1</span></u></span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_27,"Sweet! You're getting the hang of this! Try using the same image for the other two <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">""...""</span></tt> sections as well.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_28,"Great job! Now, you can try using even more and different Bootstrap components to add more content to you site and personalize it. Make it your own!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_29,"You did it! You've learned how to create a website using Bootstrap, which... you guessed it, levels you up as a Web Developer! Now, let's show off your hard work. Click on the bottom border just below your code and drag as far up as you can. Next, take a screenshot of your awesome work by pressing the <b>prt sc</b> button next to your Hack's power button.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST_30,"Nice, that'll save an image in your <b>Pictures</b> folder. You can find it by going to your desktop, then clicking on <b>Documents</b>, and then the Pictures icon on the left side of the window. Finally, you can share your pic on social media and tag us using #MadeToHack!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_QUEST_NAME,Bootstrap Like a Web Developer,,,,
BOOTQUEST2_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
BOOTQUEST2_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Level up your Bootstrap game and work with real files like real Web Developers.,,,,
BOOTQUEST2_1,"Hiya, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Great job with the first Bootstrap quest. Your work is all on Codepen, but real-world developers work with files. We're going to take the next step and work on real files instead of Codepen so that you can work on your website anywhere. Let's get the coding party started.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_2,"Remember when Saniel walked you through using the terminal? Not only can you navigate around folders, but you can also create them as well. Excited? Let's do this. We'll launch the terminal for you.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_3,"Before we get started, let's make sure you're in the home directory. In the terminal, type in the following: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd ∼/Documents</span></tt> and then hit <b>enter</b>. By the way, the letter d in Documents is case sensitive and you can find the (∼) symbol to the left of the 1 key. If you did it correctly, your terminal should read something like this: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">username@endless:∼/Documents$</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_4,"Great! Let's create a folder that will hold all of the files for your new project. Type in the following: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">mkdir myproject</span></tt> and then hit <b>enter</b>.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_5,"Change into the new folder you just created by typing: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd myproject</span></tt> and hit the <b>enter</b> button.
If you did it correctly, your terminal should read something like this: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">username@endless:∼Documents/myproject$</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_6,"Super! The file for the landing page is generally called an <b>index</b> file, and it will have all of your <b>HTML</b> code. Let's create your index file by typing in the following: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">touch index.html</span></tt> and hit the <b>enter</b> button. The naming standard for an <b>HTML</b> file is the name of the file (in this case, it's index), a period (.) and then the type of file (<b>HTML</b>).",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_7,"Finally, we'll need to make another folder to store your files. Type in the following in terminal: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">mkdir images</span></tt> and hit the <b>enter</b> button. Great! Check to make sure you have two folders and one file in your myproject folder. In terminal, type in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> and then hit the <b>enter</b> button.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_8,"Back in our previous activity, remember that we needed to import some files? Importing a file means you are bringing a file from a different program into the one you're using. Instead of importing the files over the internet, we will download these files to your computer so you can work on your webpage anywhere and at any time; you won't need an internet connection.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_9,"We will open a new window with the Bootstrap website. If a new window doesn't open, click the following link <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/download/</span></u> If you need to switch between the open apps, press and hold the alt + tab to bring up a list. While holding alt, keep pressing tab and release to select the app.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_10,"Next, you'll need to download Bootstrap's <b>CSS</b> and <b>Javascript</b> files for it to work correctly. Find the <b>Compiled CSS and JS</b> section and click the <b>Download</b> button. The files will be downloaded into your Downloads folder. ",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_11,"Click on the yellow folder located at the bottom left corner of your screen and click the <b>Downloads</b> link on the left panel to open the folder. Right-click the Bootstrap file you just downloaded and select <b>Extract Here</b>. If you are using a Hack computer, use two fingers and press the mouse pad to right-click. If you did it correctly, a new folder should appear.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_12,"Open the Bootstrap folder and while holding the shift button, click on the <b>CSS</b> and <b>JS</b> files. Right-click on the <b>CSS</b> folder and select <b>Copy</b>. Next, click on the Documents link on the left panel, double-click myproject, right-click in the white space and select <b>Paste</b>. The <b>CSS</b> and <b>JS</b> folders should appear in your myproject folder.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_13,"Take a breath. We're almost done with the setup part, so hang in there just a bit longer. To see some of the cool effects, we will need to import another <b>Javascript</b> library called <b>jQuery</b>. We'll open a window with a lot of code, but don't worry, we'll walk you through this. If another window doesn't open, click on the following link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js</span></u>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_14,"Woah, that's a lot of code! Download the code by right-clicking anywhere on the page, select <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Save as...</span></tt>, click the Documents link on the left panel, double-click myproject, double-click js, and click the <b>Save</b> button at the top right corner of the popup window. Awesome! You should now see jquery-3.4.1.min.js in the list of documents.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_15,"I know that was a lot of steps; great job hanging in there! We will now add the Bootstrap starter code to your index.html file. If a new window doesn't open, click the following link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/</span></u>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_16,Scroll down a bit until you see the Starter template section. Copy the code by clicking the <b>Copy</b> link located at the top right corner of the box.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_17,"Go back into the myproject folder by clicking the yellow folder at the bottom left corner of the screen &gt; Documents &gt; myproject and right-click on your index.html file. Select <b>Open With Other Application</b> &gt; View All Applications &gt; Sublime Text and click the <b>Select</b> button at the top right corner of the window. If you haven't installed Sublime Text, launch the <b>More Apps</b> application from the desktop and install it for free.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_18,Your index.html file should be empty. Right-click anywhere on Sublime text and click select <b>Paste</b>. All of the code from the Bootstrap page is now on your Sublime Text file. Sweet.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_19,"Notice that the tab at the top left of Sublime text has a dot next to index.html. The dot means that you have made changes to the index.html file that hasn't been saved. Save the file by pressing <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + s</span></tt>. After the file is saved, the dot will change into an ""x"". Make sure you save the file each time you make changes or else your changes will not be applied.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_20,"Great! Let's take a look at what we have so far. Go back to your myprojects folder, right-click on the index.html file, and select <b>Open With Google Chrome</b>. Remember, you will edit code on your <b>HTML</b> file with <b>Sublime Text</b> and view your webpage using <b>Google Chrome</b>. You can quickly switch between your open apps by holding alt and pressing tab.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_21,"Congrats! This is your very first webpage made from files on your computer. It's not very interesting right now, but we're going to change that by adding a few Bootstrap components. We will open a new window with the Bootstrap website. If a new window doesn't open, click the following link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/carousel/</span></u>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_22,"Scroll down the Carousel section a bit until you see the section called <b>With captions</b>. Click the <b>Copy</b> link at the top right corner with the box of code, go back to your index.html file in Sublime text, paste the code on line 15 by pressing <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + v</span></tt>, and save the file by hitting <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + s</span></tt>.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_23,"Great! Refresh the Chrome browser with your project. The correct browser would say *Hello, world!"" in the tab. What happened? The carousel doesn't look like the one on the Bootstrap page. Why do you think that is? Think back to the first Bootstrap activity.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_24,One reason why the feature doesn't work properly is that we didn't add links to an image file. Let's fix the problem.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_25,"We've added a few images into your images folder, so you don't have to worry about it. The carousel has three different slides (lines 23, 30, and 37). Thinking back in the last Bootstrap exercise, do you remember how to add an image to the carousel? If not, don't worry because I have your back.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_26,"For lines 23, 30, and 37, find the ""..."" located next to src. Replace the three dots on line 23 with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">images/dog.jpg</span></tt>, line 30 with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">images/cats.jpg</span></tt>, and line 37 with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">images/bird.jpg</span></tt>. Save your code by pressing <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + s</span></tt>.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_27,Way to go! Refresh the project Chrome browser and your carousel should display three images.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_28,"Go back to Sublime Text and find line 9. Notice that the <b>href</b> or hyperlink reference points to a site online. If you don't have an internet connection, your computer would be unable to pull in the data from that file. Since we've downloaded the files, we can change the <b>href</b> link to point to a folder on our computer to import the styles needed for Bootstrap to work. Change the <b>href</b> link in between the quotation marks on line 9 to be <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">css/bootstrap.min.css</span></tt> and delete everything from the ending quotation mark up to the (&gt;) character. Line 9 would read <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/bootstrap.min.css""&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_29,"Great, don't forget to save your Sublime text file. Go back to your Chrome browser and refresh your project browser. We still have three more links that we need to change. Do you know which lines we need to change on your index.html file?",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_30,"You probably guess it. We need to change lines 55, 56, and 57. All these three <b>&lt;script&gt;</b> tags are pointing to a remote location.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_31,"Find line 55 on your Sublime Text editor and change the src link in between the quotation marks to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">js/jquery-3.4.1.min.js</span></tt> and delete everything after the closing quotation mark up to the (&gt;) chracter. The entire line should read <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;script src=""js/jquery-3.4.1.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_32,"Next, change the link for line 56 to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">js/bootstrap.bundle.com.js</span></tt> and line 57 to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">js/bootstrap.min.js</span></tt> Save the Sublime Text file and refresh the Chrome project browser. If you did it correctly, the carousel should still rotate on its own after a few seconds. Great job!",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_33,Let's try adding another component to your webpage. Go back to the Bootstrap component page on your Chrome browser and click on the Jumbotron link on the left column. Scroll down a bit and find the code just below the first Jumbotron example. Click on the copy link on the top right corner next to the code.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_34,"Go back to Sublime Text and add a new line between lines 52 and 53. Paste the code you just copied by using the mousepad or pressing <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + v</span></tt> on line 53. Finally, save your Sublime Text file and refresh your Chrome project browser. Great! You should now see the second module just under the carousel.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_35,"Ok, let's add one more module to your webpage. Go back to the Bootstrap component page on your Chrome browser and click on the card link on the left column. Scroll down the page until you find the section called Card groups. Click on the copy link to copy the code for the module.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_36,"Go back to Sublime Text and add a line between lines 59 and 60. Paste the code you copied into line 60, save your Sublime Text file, and refresh your Chrome project browser. If you did it correctly, you should see the third block appear on your webpage. Way to go! You can reuse the images from lines 23, 30, and 37 for the image links on lines 62, 70, and 78. Save your Sublime Text file and refresh the Chrome project browser.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_37,Way to go! There's one last thing we need to do before we're done. Notice that your content stretches from one edge of the browser to the other. We can add some spacing on each side to center the content to make your webpage more readable. Go to your Sublime Text editor and add a line between lines 85 and 86.,daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_38,"On line 14, replace the contents with the following code <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;div class=""container""&gt;</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;/div&gt;</span></tt> on line 86. Save your Sublime Text file and refresh your Chrome project browser. If you did it correctly, you should see some spacing on the left and right side of the page. Finish up the project by changing the text and/or images to whatever you like.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_39,"You did it! By completing this activity, you learned how to create an <b>HTML</b> website using Bootstrap and link downloaded files to make it work. You've leveled up your skills as a Web Developer! Take a screenshot of your excellent work by pressing the <b>prt sc</b> button next to your Hack's power button.",daemon,,,
BOOTQUEST2_40,"You can find the image by going to your desktop, then open the Documents folder, and click the Pictures icon on the left side of the window. Finally, share your pic on social media and tag us using #MadeToHack.",daemon,,,
