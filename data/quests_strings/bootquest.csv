BOOTQUEST_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn to use Bootstrap, one of the fastest and most popular web libraries out there!",,,,
BOOTQUEST_1,"Hiya, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! You've been doing some great website work so far - but I'm sure you've wondered if there was a <b>really</b> fast way to build a website.",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_2,"Well, there is! There's lots of code out there in these big collections called <b>libraries</b> - grab one of those, and you've got a ton of basic (and sometimes advanced!) functions and pieces already figured out for you. ",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_3,"<b>Bootstrap</b> is one of the most popular <b>libraries</b> out there, and since the code has all been used and reused thousands of times, it has barely any bugs. That's a big weight off your shoulders!",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_4,"Let's jump right into creating a website with Bootstrap. If your browser doesn't open, click on the following link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://codepen.io/Hack-Computer/pen/ExamVOm</span></u>",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_5,"You might recognize CodePen from some of your previous activities in the Web Pathway. This time, though, we're starting with a (relatively) blank canvas.",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_6,"If you look at the <b>CSS</b> and <b>JS</b> panes, you can click the <b>gear</b> icon at the top of each of those panes to see that we've already <b>imported</b> some code for you. This is how you use a library - you <b>import</b> it. It's like referring to a character that was introduced earlier on in a book series. ""If you want to know more about Jeff, read the previous book."" By the way, you can move the box you are reading this text by placing your mouse over it and clicking the arrow at the top.",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_7,"In that same way, all the bits that make up <b>Bootstrap</b> are referred to in the library we <b>imported</b>, and you can just refer to them and have them work.",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_8,"This lets <b>Bootstrap</b> do all the heavy lifting, which frees you up to concentrate on the overall design of the website.",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_9,"Let's take a look at the Bootstrap components you'll be using for the project. I'll launch another tab on your browser. If another tab doesn't appear, click on the following link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/</span></u>",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_10,"These <b>Components</b> are all included in <b>Bootstrap</b>, all you have to do is reference them, and they'll show up in their full glory, like the heroic ranger the author introduced 5 chapters ago that rides in to save the day!",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_11,"Let's add a <b>Carousel</b> to your page - lots of websites have these, it's that big image at the top that changes every so often. Click on the <b>Carousel</b> link in the left-hand section of the page, then find the section called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">With controls</span></tt>. Just under the image, youâ€™ll see a bit of code with a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Copy</span></tt> link at the top right corner.",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_12,"Click the link to copy the code and paste it into line 11 of your Codepen. If you have a mouse connected, <b>right-click</b> and select <b>Paste</b>. On a Hack laptop, click the mousepad with two fingers and select <b>Paste</b> or just <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">CTRL + V</span></tt>.",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_13,"You won't notice a huge change because the carousel doesn't have any pictures to display, but we're about to fix that.",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_14,"Find the first of the three <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img&gt;</span></tt> tags. To the right of img, replace the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">...</span></tt> with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">""<u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/happycat1</span></u>""</span></tt>. Don't forget to keep the quotation marks. :)",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_15,"The line should look like this: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img src=""<u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/happycat1</span></u>"" class=""d-block w-100"" alt=""...""&gt;</span></tt>",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_16,"Boom, the carousel appeared with an image. Great job!",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_17,"Now do the same thing for the other two <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;img&gt;</span></tt> tags using <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF""><u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/catpicture1</span></u></span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF""><u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">http://bit.ly/gingie</span></u></span></tt>.",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_18,Awesome! Now your carousel will rotate between three images.,daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_19,Let's try adding a <b>Jumbotron</b> component to your page - This component lets you show off a bit of text in a really big way!,daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_20,"As before, look on the left of the Bootstrap page and find the <b>Jumbotron</b> section. Click it, then scroll down in the main part of the page until you find the <b>Fluid Jumbotron</b>. ",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_21,Click the <b>Copy</b> link at the top right corner and paste the code just under your carousel on line 32 of your Codepen.,daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_22,"Awesome! If you did it correctly, you should see the same block that was displayed on the Bootstrap page just under your carousel. Cool, right?",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_23,Nice job on the <b>Jumbotron</b> and <b>Carousel</b>! Let's keep going and add some more information to your page in the form of some cards. Cards are a great way to provide a lot of information in a small space.,daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_24,"First, though, add an empty line between lines 37 and 38 of your CodePen. We'll need that space!",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_25,"Head back to the Bootstrap library page, and find the <b>Card</b> section in the left pane. Click it, and then scroll down in the main part of the page until you find <b>Card decks</b> section. Grab that code, and paste it into line 38.",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_26,"Like the <b>Carousel</b>, it'll show up with broken images at first - don't worry, we'll fix that. Find the first <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">""...""</span></tt> section and replace it with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">""<u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://bit.ly/happycat1</span></u>""</span></tt>",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_27,"Sweet! You're getting the hang of this! Try using the same image for the other two <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">""...""</span></tt> sections as well.",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_28,"Great job! Now, you can try using even more and different Bootstrap components to add more content to you site and personalize it. Make it your own!",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_29,"You did it! You've learned how to create a website using Bootstrap, which... you guessed it, levels you up as a Web Developer! Now, let's show off your hard work. Click on the <b>Change View</b> button at the top right corner of your CodePen and select <b>Full Page View</b>. Next, take a screenshot of your awesome work by pressing the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">prt sc</span></tt> (print screen) button on your keyboard - it'll be at the top. If the box where you're reading these instructions are in your way, move it by mousing over the box and click on the arrow.",daemon2,,,
BOOTQUEST_30,"Nice, that'll save an image in your <b>Pictures</b> folder. You can find it by going to your desktop, then clicking on <b>Documents</b>, and then the Pictures icon on the left side of the window. Finally, you can share your pic on social media and tag us using #MadeToHack!",daemon2,,,
