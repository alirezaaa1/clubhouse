P5JSGIF1_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Let's load up some cool animated gifs as a start to our animated art piece!
",,,,
P5JSGIF1_1,"Welcome, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Today, we'll be learning how to make a <b>collage</b> out of animated gifs.If you've never made a <b>collage</b>, don't worry - it's a type of art made by sticking a big collection of different things together.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_2,"<b>p5.js</b> has a live online editor we can use - If it doesn't open automatically, use this link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://editor.p5js.org/</span></u>",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_3,"Every p5.js sketch has two main parts: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw()</span></tt>.  The <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup</span></tt> only runs once, while the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw</span></tt> stays running on loop.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_4,"You can think of <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup</span></tt> as where we prepare our canvas and supplies, and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">draw</span></tt> as where we make our art.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_5,"Right now, in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup</span></tt>, we're creating a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">canvas</span></tt> which is 400 pixels by 400 pixels.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_6,Why don't we make this a bit bigger to give us more space to work with?,daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_7,"Replace <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">createCanvas(400,400);</span></tt> with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">createCanvas(600,600);</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_8,"Next, we need to find a gif to use - I like to use <b>giphy</b> to search for gifs. Let's visit <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">http://giphy.com</span></u> and search for <b>kitten</b>.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_9,"Select a gif you like, find the button that says <b>copy link</b>, and click it.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_10,"A box will pop up with 3 links in it - Select the web address in the <b>GIF Link</b> box, and press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + C</span></tt> to copy it.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_11,"Now, let's add this gif to our p5.js sketch!",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_12,"First, we need to declare a <b>variable</b> to store the gif.  At the top of your sketch, before <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt>, add the following line: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">let gif;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_13,"Next, we need to load that gif. Since we are linking to an external file, we want to make sure the file is loaded before our sketch begins. We can do this by creating a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">preload()</span></tt> function.",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_14,"Before <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">setup()</span></tt>, add the following: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">function preload() {</span></tt>   (Press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Enter</span></tt> to get a new line)  <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">gif = loadImage('url');</span></tt>  (Press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Enter</span></tt> to get a new line)  <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">}</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_15,Now replace <b>url</b> with the link you copied from Giphy.,daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_16,"Now, let's change the background to white so we can see our image better. Add the following line: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">background(255);</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_17,"Add our image below that line with: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">image(gif, 0, 0);</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSGIF1_18,"We now know how to display an animated gif from the internet. Next time, we'll learn how to play and pause it!",daemon,,,
