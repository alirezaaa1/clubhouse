INSPECTOR1_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Ada reveals a tool for hacking webpages, hidden inside your browser!",,,,
INSPECTOR1_1,"Hello, *{{user_name}}*. I hope you've been having fun with Riley, learning about the web.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR1_2,"Learning coding is like learning a language - there's writing, but there's also reading. You might be able to write a webpage, but can you decode one in its natural habitat?",ada,,,
INSPECTOR1_3,Let's go take a look at a real webpage and see if we can pick it apart. Open your browser and go to `http://hack-computer.com`,ada,,,
INSPECTOR1_4,"Here we are! Normally, when you see a webpage, what you're looking at is the result of your browser reading all the code in the webpage, and then interpreting it.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR1_5,"If we want to see the actual code, we need to use the *page inspector*. This tool will let you view and change the code of any webpage!",ada,,,
INSPECTOR1_6,"Just one thing before we dive into the inspector - If you're using a Hack laptop, you can press on the touchpad with 2 fingers to right-click.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR1_7,Let's open the inspector. Right-click anywhere on the page and select *Inspect*. You can also just press `Ctrl + Shift + I`,ada,,,
INSPECTOR1_8,"Oh my, that's quite a lot of complicated code! Don't worry, though, I'll walk you through it. First of all, you should notice that the Inpector popped in from the *right-hand* side of the browser.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR1_9,"That scrollbar you see near the center is the one that used to be on the far right. It still scrolls the webpage, try it. The right edge of that scrollbar is draggable - you can use that to adjust how much screen space the Inspector takes up.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR1_10,"You should also see that the Inspector is divided into two halves - top and bottom. For now, we're only interested in the half that says *Elements* at the top. (You can grab the middle bar of the Inspector and drag around to give youself more space if you like.)",ada,,,
INSPECTOR1_11,"Now, click the icon in the *top left corner of the Inspector* - it should look like an arrow pointing at a box. This is the *Select Element* button - a fancy way of saying ""it's for picking the thing you want to look at.""",ada,,,
INSPECTOR1_12,"Now, mouse over the left-hand side of your browser window, where the actual webpage is. Notice how different parts of the page turn different colors? If you look back to the inspector, you'll see the code for the colored area get highlighted as you move the mouse.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR1_14,Click the words “Hack Laptop” on the webpage (not the inspector). Notice that the inspector will highlight the line that reads: `<span style=”font-family...”> Hack Laptop </span>.`,ada,,,
INSPECTOR1_15,"In the Inspector pane, within the highlighted line, double-click the word “Hack”. This will select the text, and let you edit it. Change it to something else, then hit `Enter`!",ada,,,
INSPECTOR1_16,"Now, look back at the left-hand pane. *Hack Laptop* should be gone, and your text should be in its place! Now *that's* hacking a webpage!",ada,,,
INSPECTOR1_17,"At this point, you might be wondering if anyone else saw the changes we made. No, they only happened on your computer. When you load a webpage in your browser, you're essentially getting sent a 'copy' of the 'master' page. If you refresh, all your changes will disappear - you're getting a new 'copy' from the server.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR1_18,"That's enough for the moment, but I've got some more tricks ready for the Inspector. Come back for part 2 and I'll show you!",ada,,,
