INSPECTOR2_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
INSPECTOR2_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Ada shows you some more cool tricks for the Inspector!,,,,
INSPECTOR2_1,"Hello again, *{{user_name}}*. Ready to do some more webpage hacking with the Inspector?",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_2,"Let's dive right in - start your browser and point it to http://hack-computer.com, then open that Inspector gadget (Ctrl + Shift + I).",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_3,"Here we are again! Activate the *Select Element* button in the *top left corner of the Inspector*. Remember, it looks like an arrow pointing at a box.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_4,"Click on any of the images in the page, and notice that the inspector will highlight the line that adds that image to the page. It should start with the image tag: `<img src=""..."">`",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_5,"Let's replace that image. To do that, all we need to do is change the address inside the `src=""...""` part of the tag.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_6,"In the Inspector, double-click on the text inside the quotes (""""), then hit delete to erase the text. The image should disappear from the page.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_7,"Now, replace that text with this: http://bit.ly/happycat1 (Press `Enter` when you're done).",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_8,"Perfect. Hey, Felix, come check out what *{{user_name}}* just did!",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_9,"_Prrow. Nyan!_
`<Felix looks pleased.>`",felixnet,,,
INSPECTOR2_10,I knew he'd like it. The approval of a cat is always a good thing to have.,ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_11,"Let's try a technique you might already know, but from a different angle. Turn on the *Element Selector* again and select the paragraph just below the “Learning Pathways” title. Think about how you could make that text orange. If you have an idea, give it a try.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_12,"Here's how I'd do it - Once you've selected that text using the *Element Selector*, look in the Inspector pane, at the highlighted text. The tag will probably need you to click the sideways arrow next to the text to 'unpack' the tag and let you see everything.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_13,"I definitely recognize some of the code in there, `style=...` should look famillar. Let's change the color to `color:orange`.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_14,"Nice work! You can do that with text in any webpage - Who knows, maybe someone hid some text by making it the same color as the background.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_15,"For our next trick, look for a bar in the inspector that has tabs labeled `Styles`, `Event Listeners`, `DOM Breakpoints`, `Properties`, and `Accessibility`. Drag it up a little to enlarge it if you need to.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_16,"Your Inspector should now be evenly split between the ""page code"" view you were using previously, and this new multi-tabbed section.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_17,Click the *Styles* tab and check out the first line. This tab lets you see all the CSS rules that are active on the page - That's a *lot* of rules!,ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_18,"But check this out - if you use the *Element Selector* to select the text that you turned orange, you should see your style on the very first line! Isn't that cool?",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_19,"You can edit that code here, in the CSS tab, as well. Try changing it to another color (if you want to get fancy, try a hex color).",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_20,"Next, let’s try hacking a link. Remember, a link can be attached to anything - a button, an image, a video...",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_21,"If you're having trouble finding one, try selecting one of the ""Learn More"" buttons.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_22,"When you've found a link, select it with the *Element Selector*. The inspector should highlight some code that starts with `<a...` What we want is the `href=""...""` part of the tag, which controls where the link goes.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_23,"When you've found it, double-click the text in between the quotes in the `href=""...""` part, and replace it with `http://www.nyan.cat`",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_24,"OK, now you can close the Inspector. Let's test your hacked link, see you on the other side!",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_25,"See, Felix? I told you that *{{user_name}}* knew what you liked!",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_26,"_Brbrbrbr..._
`<Felix puffs himself up and purrs quietly.>`",felixnet,,,
INSPECTOR2_27,"Well, looks like you scored 10/10 in Felix's book, *{{user_name}}*. I'd say that's a _purrrfect_ score. `::>^_^<::` See you later!",ada,,,
