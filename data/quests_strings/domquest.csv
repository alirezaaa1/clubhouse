DOMQUEST_QUEST_NAME,DOMinating The Web!,,,,
DOMQUEST_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
DOMQUEST_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn about the DOM tree and how to navigate it, so that you can customize your websites even better!",,,,
DOMQUEST_1,"Hey, <b>{{user_name}}</b>, the DOM (Document Object Model) is the structure at the core of every website. Mastering the DOM will let you more precisely customize the look and feel of your site, as well as add cool effects. Let's get going!",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_2,"In your previous HTML and CSS activities, you learned how to style existing tags, and then create your tags and style those too. All that work you did went into a single HTML file, which the browser reads to create the DOM, which is part of how it displays the site on your screen.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_3,"We've created a basic webpage that you can use to learn about the DOM. If the window doesn't open, click on the following link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://codepen.io/Hack-Computer/pen/WNbpOjV</span></u>",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_4,"Think back to your previous HTML lessons, and take the first step of personalizing your page by updating the front of the cards. You're going to show off your page, so make it fun!",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_5,"Look at the HTML window of your Codepen and change the text between the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;p&gt;</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;/p&gt;</span></tt> tags on <b>line 16</b> to your first favorite thing.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_6,"Great! Now let's find some images for your site. If a new tab doesn't open, open one yourself (<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + T</span></tt>) and navigate to <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://unsplash.com</span></u>",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_7,"Find an image you like by using the search bar located at the center of the page. When you find an image you like, <b>right-click</b> on the photo and select <b>Copy image address.</b> If you are using a Hack laptop, use two fingers and click on the mouse pad to bring up the menu.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_8,"Go back to the HTML section of Codepen and delete the link between the quotation marks on <b>line 17</b>. Paste your new link in between the quotation marks by <b>right-clicking</b> the spot between the quotation marks and selecting <b>Paste</b>. If you did it right, your new image should appear on the card. For our Hack laptop users, click on the mouse pad with two fingers to bring up the menu and select <b>Paste</b>.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_9,"Way to go! Let's personalize the back of the card. Like before, change all of the text between <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;p&gt;</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;/p&gt;</span></tt> on <b>lines 20-23</b> in the HTML section to your reasons.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_10,Great job! You've personalized the front and back of your first card! Use your mouse and hover over the first card in the blue column to see what you've accomplished. Try personalizing the other eight cards on the page.,daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_11,"Super! As the browser reads all that HTML and CSS, it built the tags into a structure that looks a lot like an upside-down tree.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_12,"If you remember back when Ada was teaching you about the Inspector, she walked you through how to view and edit a live website. Whenever you use the Inspector, you're poking around a representation of the Document Object Model (DOM) tree.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_13,"Here is a simplified map of the DOM for this page. Think of it as your treasure map that will lead you to the answer. If a window doesn't open, click on the following link: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">http://bit.ly/maphackdom</span></u>",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_14,"Now that you've seen that map try and see how it lines up with the code on the page you're looking at, showing how all the data is organized. Once you can read a map like this, and understand how the DOM is laid out, it makes it a lot easier to do cool things like that card-flipping animation.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_15,"OK, let's try something that uses our ability to target specific parts of the page using the DOM. How about changing the color of the text on the front of the first card in the green column?",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_16,"Now, you could just add some in-line styling, as you did in previous activities, but this time we're going to do it the more advanced way - and it actually ends up being easier!",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_17,"Scroll to the bottom of the <b>CSS</b> section of the CodePen page (it might be minimized, double-click on <b>CSS</b> to open it up), and type in the following text: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">.green-column .card1 .front p { color: pink }</span></tt>",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_18,Nice! Do you see the change on the page? You just turned the text on the front of the first card in the green column into pink text! Do you notice anything interesting about the <b>CSS</b> you typed in?,daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_19,"You probably guessed it already - Those parts with the ""."" (period) in front of them are being used to ""navigate"" down through the DOM to end up in a specific part, and that's the part that <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">color: pink</span></tt> gets applied to.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_20,"Take another look at the DOM map and see if you can trace the ""pathway"" your code took.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_21,Now that you've personalized the front of the card let's try targeting the back of the card so you can personalize it. Take a moment and look at the code. Can you guess how we would go about that?,daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_22,"You probably already guessed it, but we only have to change one term to make the back of the card have pink text as well. Type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">.green-column .card1 .back p { color: pink }</span></tt> on the line below your previous CSS. The <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">back</span></tt> class you typed is telling the browser to target the back of the card, as opposed to the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">front</span></tt>.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_23,"Check out the HTML for the back of any of the cards - see how there are multiple different <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;p&gt;</span></tt> tags? What if you only wanted to touch one of them? You <b>could</b> use in-line styling again, but you can also navigate through the DOM to do it.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_24,"If you have multiple items of the same type one after the other, like the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;p&gt;</span></tt> tags, you can use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">itemtype:nth-child(somenumber)</span></tt> to target one particular one. For example, let's color the text of the second <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;p&gt;</span></tt> tag. We can do that by typing <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">.green-column .card2 .back p:nth-child(2) { color: orange }</span></tt> into the CSS section of your page.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_25,"If you flip the second card, you should see that the 2nd <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;p&gt;</span></tt> tag's text is orange! Look at the HTML code for the back of any card. See how the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;p&gt;</span></tt> are just below the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;div&gt;</span></tt>? The <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;div&gt;</span></tt> is the parent of <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;p&gt;</span></tt>, or you can say that <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;p&gt;</span></tt> is a child of the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;div&gt;</span></tt>. It works a lot like a family tree.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_26,"One final bit. Siblings are all on the same level, like in a family. For example, all of the cards in the blue columns are siblings of each other, but a child of the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;div&gt;</span></tt> that holds them.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_27,"Look at the code for the back of the first card in the orange column. Notice that the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;p&gt;</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;h3&gt;</span></tt> are both at the same level and in the same <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;div&gt;</span></tt>, so they are siblings. Type the following to change the styling of the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;h3&gt;</span></tt> sibling: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">.orange-column .card1 .back p + h3 { color: blue }</span></tt>.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_28,"Flip the first card in the orange column, and you will see that the &lt;h3&gt; will have blue text. Sweet!",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_29,What happens if you removed .card1 from the code above? Edit the code and flip over the cards in the orange column.,daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_30,"Based on how specific you get with your DOM targeting, you can affect one or many elements. Let's try changing the font for the card title of the middle card in the green column. Type the following in the CSS window: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">.green-column .flip:nth-child(2) {font-family: ""Comic Sans MS; font-size: 21px;""}</span></tt>.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_31,"Great job! Next, remove <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">:nth-child(2)</span></tt> from the code you just typed. You've now changed the CSS to be less specific, so you are now targeting all of the card titles in the DOM. CSS is powerful, right?!",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_32,"When you're done and ready to show it off, click on the <b>Change View</b> button at the top right corner of your Codepen and select <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Full Page View</span></tt>.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_33,"You did it! By completing this activity, you learned what the DOM tree is and how to target different parts of it to personalize your site. You've taken a major step in your coding journey. Click on the <b>Change View</b> button at the top right corner of your Codepen and select <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Full Page View</span></tt>. Next, take a screenshot of your awesome work by pressing the <b>prt sc</b> button next to your Hack's power button.",daemon3,,,
DOMQUEST_34,"You can find the image by going to your desktop, then open the Documents folder, and click the Pictures icon on the left side of the window. Finally, share your pic on social media and tag us using #MadeToHack.",daemon3,,,
