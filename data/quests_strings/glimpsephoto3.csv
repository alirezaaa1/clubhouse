GLIMPSEPHOTO3_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"In this activity, you'll learn to use the Smart Scissors Tool to ""cut"" an object from one picture and ""paste"" it into another!",,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_1,"Hey there, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Let's get started - I'll fire up Glimpse and show you how to move an object from one image to another. In this lesson, we'll use a star, but in the future, it can be anything you want!",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_2,"Now that you're in <b>Glimpse</b>, let'sc get our star. Go to File &lt; Open, and then, using the file browser that opens up, go to your <b>home</b> directory (it's got your username on it, on the left side of the file browser). Once you're there, navigate into your <b>Pictures</b> folder, then into <b>GlimpseSources</b>, where you'll find <b>star.png</b>.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_3,"Now, we'll need to open up another photo to move the star into. If you don't have one you like, you can always download one from <b>Wikipedia</b> or <b>Google Image Search</b>. Once you've got the image you want, go back to Glimpse and use File &lt; Open... to pull it up.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_4,"You should now have two images in the top left part of Glimpse. These are <b>thumbnails</b>, or tiny versions of the pictures.  Each <b>thumbnail</b> is a tab. Try clicking on them to switch back and forth, but don't click the X by each one. That will close the tab! If it happens, just go to File &lt; Open again.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_5,"Now select the tab with the picture you chose. We're getting ready for our star, so first we'll need to create a shiny new layer. Look for the Layer list, probably on the right side. You should see an eyeball next to a list of the Layers you have here. ",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_6,"Each Layer is like a sheet of thin, transparent plastic. If you draw or put an image on a Layer, then it works like a clear sheet with a picture on it. If you stack the Layers, you'll see all the images on top of each other.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_7,"See that little sheet icon with a plus symbol? It's underneath the Layer list, on the left. Click on it to create a new Layer, and then double-click on the name of that Layer. You can rename it to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">star</span></tt> or something similar. ",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_8,"Now click on the <b>thumbnail</b> of the star so you can switch to that picture. We've got a nice fresh layer just waiting for it, but we want to make sure we only take the star and not that white background. ",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_9,"We'll need the Scissors Select Tool, in the top right corner of the tools. Once you have it selected, you can click and drag to create a line. Do this along part of the outline of the star. If the line ends up bent, you can click-and-drag on the bent part. Want more tips?",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_10,"Try clicking on each new point of the outline and let the computer fill in the line. If you put a line in the wrong place, Undo will get rid of it. If the computer makes a line all zigzag for no reason, click-and-drag it into shape. Get a smaller zigzag? Do the same thing again.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_11,"Keep going till you make it all the way around the star. The smoother your lines are, the nicer the finished product will look. You want these lines to trace the outside of your object (in this case, a star) as closely as possible. You'll see why soon.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_12,"Once your outline is complete, you can click inside it or press enter to turn that area into a <b>selection</b>. Once that area is <b>selected</b> you are ready to Cut or Copy your star. ",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_13,"Cut and Copy will both take a copy of your star that you can add to the other picture, but Cut will also remove it from this picture. I like to use Cut so I can see if I actually did it. I can always use Undo if I messed up! Cut is ctrl+x, and Copy is ctrl+c.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_14,"Okay, now go back to the tab holding the picture you chose. (Click the thumbnail of your picture at the top left.) Make sure the empty <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Star</span></tt> Layer is selected, or whatever you named it. Then use ctrl+v to Paste the star into this image. Wait to click on anything else.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_15,"Use the Move Tool (looks like two crossed arrows) to drag your star into the position you want. Now, let me explain exactly where your star is.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_16,"You see, right now it's just floating in space. You may have noticed a new Layer in your layer list, called ""Floating Selection (Pasted Layer)."" When you have it in the right place, move the cursor off your star. When you see a little anchor appear by your cursor, click.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_17,"Did the Floating Selection layer disappear? That's because the <b>selection</b> that was floating in midair (the star) is now <b>anchored</b> to the Layer called ""Star."" Basically, you told Glimpse where that floating thing should land and now it's stuck on that Layer.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_18,"You can still use the Move Tool to move the star around, but now you're moving the whole Layer as well. Wanna see a cool trick?",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_19,"You can turn your star transparent with the Opacity slider, just on top of the Layer list. If your mouse is in the top half of that bar, you can click to drag it. If your mouse is in the bottom half of the Opacity bar, you can click to enter a number value (out of 100). Try it!",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_20,"When your star is in the right place and it's the right Opacity, you're ready to go to File &lt; Save As... Remember!! If you use Save instead of Save As, it will save that over the original photo. Save As will make a copy with your changes.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO3_21,"When you do your own projects, you can also change the size of what you Copy and Paste. Just right-click on the Layer and select ""Scale Layer,"" then enter the dimensions you'd like it to be! Do you know what your next project will be? Have fun!",daemon2,,,
