GLIMPSEPHOTO2_QUEST_NAME,Edit a Photo - Changing The Look,,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"In this activity, you'll learn to use a bunch of tools in Glimpse that can massively change how a photo looks!",,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_1,"Hi there! Ever wanted to make a cool art photo with a neat effect? If you weren't sure how, today is the day you'll learn some cool techniques. Open up Glimpse and we'll get started.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_2,"First off, pick a photo you want to edit. If you don't have one of your own, you can search the web or look at Wikipedia articles. A photo of a person is best to start with. Now you'll need to click File &lt; Open... and pull it up in Glimpse.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_3,"If you like, you can retouch the photo, like the last actvity showed you. Once you're done with that, we can start making some big changes to its appearance! First, locate the Colors menu at the top.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_4,"Now select Colors &lt; Posterize (it's near the bottom). You can adjust the ""Posterize levels"" to find what looks best, but can you imagine a thematic word along the bottom of your image? ",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_5,"If you think this looks cool and you want to save it, we're going to use a special kind of Save called 'Save As...' which makes a copy of the original document and gives us a chance to edit the name before saving that data on the hard drive. Go to File &lt; Save As...",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_6,"After you give it a name and hit the 'Save' button, Glimpse will save this version of the picture. But what happens to the old version without changes? It's still there! Try going to File &lt; Open... again and reopen the old version.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_7,"Now let's try a different tool! After each one, you have the option to ""Save As"" or just close it and reopen the original file. Once you've got the base version pulled up, you're ready for the next one.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_8,"Go to Colors &lt; Colorize (it's also near the bottom). It turns your photo to a vibrant color! You can adjust which one by clicking inside the Color box at the bottom. Or experiment with the sliders to see how they affect things. Use the ""Split view"" option to see before/after.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_9,"Now, if you like it, go to File &lt; Save As... and give it a cool name. Once you do that, use File &lt; Open to select your base image again.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_10,"Now try Colors &lt; Desaturate &lt; Color to Gray. It might take a minute, but the computer will show you a black-and-white version of your photo. If you click 'Enhance Shadows' you might find that it looks like almost like a pencil drawing. But what about those sliders?",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_11,"The 'Radius' slider tells the computer how far around a pixel to look before deciding what color this area is and assigning a <b>gray value</b>, which is just a shade of gray.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_12,"We'll come back to the 'Samples' slider and jump to 'Iterations'. This tells Glimpse how many ""iterations"" to do each time it looks at a pixel group to decide the gray-value. Have you ever had to double check your math by doing a problem twice? That's what this is.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_13,"The more 'iterations' the harder it is for your computer's brain, the Central Processing Unit (or CPU). But the result? Your final picture will look a lot smoother and more realistic with less <b>noise</b>. When a picture looks grainy, almost like sand's been spilled, we call it <b>noise</b>.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_14,Now for the 'Samples' slider! This is similar to 'Iterations' but it helps Glimpse get a more accurate reading on what the color is and what the <b>gray value</b> should be. Try moving the different sliders and see how the results change!,daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_15,"Now, as you try to move the sliders, you might notice that sometimes they do different things. When the cursor is in the bottom half of a slider, it shows two arrow, pointing in opposite directions. If you click while it looks like this, you can type a number in for that value.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_16,"When the cursor is in the top half of a slider, it looks like an up arrow. If you click when it looks this way, the slider will jump to wherever your mouse is. You can also use the small arrows on the right of each bar. Try it all, and find what you like!",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_17,"Remember to Save As and Open a base version again if you need to, then we'll make it look like an old cowboy photograph!",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_18,"Go to Colors &lt; Desaturate &lt; Sepia. You can use the slider for ""Effect strength"" to control how much color is drained out. At very low levels, it's hard to notice and looks almost like sunlight. At the highest level, it is very yellow-brown. This color is called sepia.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_19,"Again, Save As and Open the base version if you need to. Now I'm gonna show you one of the neatest tools ever! We're going to change the <b>perspective</b> of the photo to make it look like we're viewing it from a different angle!",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_20,"Look for the Handle Transform Tool. It's near the middle right, and it looks kind of like a sheet of paper being moved, and it has arrows on the sides. You can hover the cursor over different Tools to see their names. I'll explain how to use it in a second.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_21,"Okay, this tool uses <b>handles</b> to move the picture around. Try clicking on the photo and dragging it. You've created the first <b>handle</b>! If you drag it around, the picture moves. Keep using that same <b>handle</b> though, and don't click anywhere else on the pic.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_22,"If you dragged it too far away, use the Reset button in the box that popped up. This goes back to where you started and erases all <b>handles</b>. Hit Cancel to leave this mode and go back to how it was. If you decide you like a change, hit Transform to make it stay.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_23,"When you're ready, try clicking somewhere else on the picture to add a second <b>handle</b>. Now if you drag, you'll notice the picture rotates and you can even adjust the size. This is because you can control two perspective points with two <b>handles</b>.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_24,"Remember, you can use Reset or Cancel if you mess up, and Transform to make your edit stick. Now it really gets crazy when we add a third <b>handle</b>. I'll give you some more info...",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_25,"With 3 handles, you can make it look like the photo is being turned in different directions and Glimpse will adjust the perspective. If you hover over the circle for a <b>handle</b> it expands so you can click inside to drag it. Click outside a circle and you make a new <b>handle</b>.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_26,"Remember, if you get confused or if you don't like it you can always Reset. If you hit Transform and then changed your mind, just use Undo.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_27,"Once again, use Save As... to save your masterpiece, and you'll still have your original photo. If you use Save instead, it will update the computer's copy of this photo to what you've created.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_28,Try some more tools and find new ways to turn photos into masterpieces! You can find all sorts of interesting stuff in the menus and the Tool collection. Hover over things like Tools to get more information. Don't be afraid to try something and then Undo!,daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO2_29,"I love exploring a new art program like this, just trying different things to see what they do. It's my favorite way to discover new tools for my next work of art. I hope you have fun experimenting!",daemon2,,,
