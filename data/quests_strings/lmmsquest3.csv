LMMSQUEST3_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"You've learned how to make a song, how about making your own sounds and sound effects?",,,,
LMMSQUEST3_GREET,"Hello again, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Just can't get enough of LMMS? I've got just the thing. Let's create some sound effects that you could use in a video, or even a retro game! Let's get started - I'll launch LMMS.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_1,"OK, here we go! You can close the <b>FX Mixer</b> and <b>Controller Rack</b> windows, we won't need them. Open the <b>Instrument Plugins</b> tab, from the left-hand side of the main window. It has an icon with a wavy line on it, and it's the 3rd one down if you look underneath the <b>File</b> menu.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_2,"You should now see a list with some instructions at the top. Select <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Nescaline</span></tt> from that list, and like the instructions say, drag it into your <b>Song Editor</b>. It should show up at the bottom of the <b>Song Editor</b>, right below the <b>Automation Track</b>.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_3,"Now that we have an ""instrument,"" let's change how it sounds. Double-click on Nescaline and a little window should pop up with a lot of red buttons and dials - this is how you'll create your sounds.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_4,"First, let's make the sound of a helicopter flying.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_5,"Look at the left side of Nescaline - Do you see the little red lights to the left of the <b>CH1, CH2, CH3</b> and <b>CH4</b> labels? Click those lights so that only <b>CH4</b> is red, and others are black. This means we'll only be using <b>Channel 4</b> for this sound.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_6,"Now, in the Channel 4 row, look for the dial with the <b>FREQ</b> label below it. Grab this dial with your mouse and drag up or down to set it to <b>4 or 5</b>. As you drag, a little label that says ""Noise Frequency"" and the na number will show up to let you see where the dial is.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_7,Look to the right of <b>FREQ</b> for the dials labeled <b>LEN</b> and <b>SWP</b>. Click on them and drag to make sure they're set to 0.,estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_8,"Just above the <b>LEN</b> and <b>SWP</b> dials, there are 3 buttons like the <b>CH4</b> button, labeled <b>ENV</b>, <b>∞</b> and <b>Q</b>. Turn the first 2 on, and the last one off. The first 2 lights should be red, the last one should be black.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_9,"OK, now we're ready. Press any key on your keyboard (Y or D are good choices) to hear the sound!",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_10,Now that's a whirlybird incoming!,estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_11,"Let's do another - Drag another Nescaline into the Song Editor, below the first one, and <b>double-click</b> it to open it up.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_12,"Let's make a downward ""beeeoooooowww"" sound now, like something falling.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_13,"Turn <b>CH1</b> on, and <b>CH2, CH3,</b> and <b>CH4</b> off. Use the buttons just to the left of the labels.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_14,"We want the <b>VOL</b> dial set to <b>15</b> (maximum), the <b>CRS</b> dial set to <b>0</b> (that's the middle) and the <b>LEN</b> dial set to <b>0</b> (that's the minimum value for it).",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_15,"To the right of those dials, you should see the <b>WIDTH</b> label, with 4 blocks underneath it. Click the <b>3rd</b> block, and it should turn red.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_16,"Almost there! Now, look to the right of <b>WIDTH</b> and you should see <b>SWEEP</b>. Click the button just to the left of <b>SWEEP</b> to turn it on, then set the <b>AMT</b> dial to <b>-3</b> (just left of middle) and the <b>RATE</b> dial to <b>3</b> (almost exactly at the middle).",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_17,"Now we're ready to test it out - poke a few keys on your keyboard and hear the ""drop""!",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_18,"Now, what's a falling noise without a nice <b>CRASH</b> at the end?",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_19,<i>Brrip! Mia&&w!</i>,felixnet,,,
LMMSQUEST3_20,"I should have know you'd show up as soon as we mentioned something breaking! Well, we can't disappoint him. Drag a 3rd copy of <b>Nescaline</b> into the Song Editor, then <b>double-click</b> it to open it up.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_21,"Like the Helicopter sound, this one will only use <b>Channel 4</b>, so let's turn off <b>Channel 1-3</b>",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_22,"Set the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">VOL</span></tt> dial to the maximum (15), and the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">FREQ</span></tt> to 6.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_23,"Moving right, let's set the <b>LEN</b> dial to <b>2</b> and the <b>SWP</b> dial to <b>1</b>.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_24,"Above those dials, turn <b>ENV</b>, <b>∞</b> and <b>Q</b> <b>OFF</b> - The lights should be black.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_25,"Finally, to the right of the <b>SWP</b> dial, there's another button labeled <b>NOTE</b>. Turn it <b>ON</b>, so it lights up.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_26,Now test it out on your keyboard. <b>Crash!</b>,estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_27,"Excellent work! Now that you have 3 sound effects to play with, we can pick one and <b>export</b> it into an actual sound file.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_28,"For this example, I'm picking the Helicopter sound, but you could use either of the other two if you want.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_29,"In order to play these sounds, we'll need to lay down some notes. Look in the Song Editor, in the first Nescaline row, and <b>double-click</b> the first black box to the right of the <b>Pan</b> dial. This should open the <b>Piano Roll</b> window.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_30,"In the <b>Piano Roll</b> window, click on the keys until you find one that sounds good (I used <b>C5</b>). Then, click in the black, grid-marked area to the right of that key to create a note.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_31,"Once you have a note, click and drag on the left and right ends to change the length. Press <b>Space</b> to listen and test it out!",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_32,"When you're happy with it, go the <b>File</b> menu and click <b>Export</b>.",estelle,,,
LMMSQUEST3_33,"Underneath <b>Look In:</b>, click your username, <b>{{user_name}}</b>. Name the file whatever you like, then click <b>Save</b>",estelle,,,

LMMSQUEST3_36,"Congratulations! Now you can take this sound and do whatever you want with it - Use it in a game, as a sound effect on a video, as your new phone ringtone, anything you like. It's all yours!",estelle,,,
