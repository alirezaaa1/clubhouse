WOBBLYBASH_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Get your windows wobbling like Jello through the power of OS scripting!,,,,
WOBBLYBASH_1,"Greetings. Are you ready to take a step into actual programming, *{{user_name}}*?",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_2,I thought you might be. Excellent. Let's get started - open the Terminal and get comfortable.,saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_3,"The Terminal is your key to the greatest powers of the operating system. In addition to exposing commands and settings that are normally unreachable, it's self-programming.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_4,This means you can run commands in the Terminal that tell the Terminal to do sequences of actions. We usually call these *shell scripts*.,saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_5,"But first, why would you want to use a shell script? You can enter commands into the Terminal without any trouble, correct?",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_6,What about this one? `gsettings set org.gnome.shell wobbly-object-movement-range 500`,saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_7,"I think we can both agree that command is a little too long to be convenient or easy to remember, nothing like `ls` or `cd`.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_8,"What if there were a solution? What if we could create a file that would automatically run several commands in a row? That would be rather useful, wouldn't it?",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_9,"In order to create such a file, you need to use a new tool - `nano`, a text editor that lives entirely within the Terminal. Start it by typing `nano` and pressing `Enter`.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_10,"`nano` is quite simple - You can move the cursor with the arrow keys, use `Ctrl + O` (that's O as in Oscar) to save, use `Ctrl + X` to quit, and look at the Status Bar at the bottom of the window to see any information the program wants to give you.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_11,"Really, that's it. Let's try some simple operations. Type some text (""Stonehenge is cool!""), save your file, naming it ""stone"", and then quit.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_12,"To do all that, you'd type your text, press `Ctrl + O`, look at the bottom of the window to see the save prompt, type `s`-`t`-`o`-`n`-`e`, press `Enter`, and then press `Ctrl + X`",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_13,"Once you do all that, you'll be back at the command-line. If you type `ls`, you should see a file named `stone`. `nano` will save files in your current directory (where you ran it) unless you say otherwise.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_14,"Now, let's look at that file you just created. Type `nano stone` to open the file named `stone` with `nano`.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_15,Here we are again. Good work. Let's quit again (`Ctrl + X`).,saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_16,"There's an interesting shortcut for creating a new file with `nano`: You can ""open"" a file that doesn't exist yet, and `nano` will behave as though you created a new file with that name. Try `nano myscript.sh`",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_17,"Do you see? `nano` shows ""New File"" at the bottom of the screen. You need to save to actually write this file to disk, but if you do, (`Ctrl + O`) you'll already have the filename filled in and you can just press `Enter`. Do that now.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_18,"Excellent. Now we have a file to experiment with. Let's enter a nice, long command that you'd never want to type twice if you could avoid it: `gsettings set org.gnome.shell wobbly-object-movement-range 500`",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_19,"On the next line, type `gsettings set org.gnome.shell wobbly-spring-friction 2.0`",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_20,"And on the third line, `gsettings set org.gnome.shell wobbly-
effect true`",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_21,"Last, on the fourth line, type `echo ""wobbly settings applied""`",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_22,"Good work. We just entered a sequence of commands, followed by `echo`, which lets you print text to the command-line. It's useful for seeing what a program is doing. Let's save, and then close `nano`.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_23,"Once `nano` is closed, we can run the script - type `bash myscript.sh` and then press `Enter`.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_24,"If that script printed ""wobbly settings applied"", you can try grabbing the Terminal window and dragging it around...",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_25,"Well done! You've turned all those windows into jelly, quite a feat.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_26,"Now, of course, you might want to turn that off. Can you figure out what command you might need to enter to do that? Type `nano myscript.sh` to take a look at the commands again, if you like.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_27,"If you guessed that you might need to use `gsettings set org.gnome.shell wobbly-
effect *false*`, you're at the head of the class. Now, here's the next level: Can you figure out how to make a new script that runs that command?",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_28,"Let me walk you through how I'd do that: First, I'd type `nano wobblyoff.sh` to make a new  script and open it in `nano`. Then, I'd type `gsettings set org.gnome.shell wobbly-
effect false` into the file, followed by `echo ""wobbly effects off""`, then save and quit.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_29,"Finally, I'd run that script by typing `bash wobblyoff.sh`. You might need to close and reopen the Terminal to see the window wobble go away completely.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_30,"I imagine you're feeling a bit squeezed out after that - It's a lot to take in. I'll explain a few things I skipped over, earlier.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_31,"The reason you type `bash` before your script name is because `bash` is the name of the program that the Terminal is running. It's what we call a ""shell"" - a text-only interface that accepts commands and performs operations on the file system.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_32,"You see, everything on this computer you're using is a program - `ls` is a tiny program that reads the state of the filesystem, `cd` is a tiny program that changes where the filesystem thinks you, the user, are located... It's programs all the way down.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_33,"When you run `nano`, you're running a program inside the shell, which is also a program, inside the Terminal, which is a program, inside the desktop experience... which is also a program!",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_34,"And now, of course, with shell scripting, you can create your own programs to run in the shell, by stitching together still more programs.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_35,"In the future, we'll explore more of the possibilities of shell scripting - I'm looking forward to it, you're quite a good student.",saniel,,,
