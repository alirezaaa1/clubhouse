SIDETRACK1_QUEST_NAME,Sidetrack - Robots and Pits,,,,
SIDETRACK1_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
SIDETRACK1_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Escape the maze of pits and robots,,,,
SIDETRACK1_NOTINSTALLED,"Uh-oh! Looks like `Sidetrack` isn't installed!

You need to download it from the App Center to run this quest.

Click the icon named `App Center` on the Desktop, then search for `Sidetrack`, and install it.",daemon,,,
SIDETRACK1_LAUNCH_ADA,Go ahead and Launch *Sidetrack*.,ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_LAUNCH_ADA_HINT1,Click the *Sidetrack* icon on the desktop.,,,,
SIDETRACK1_ASSIGNMENT_ADA,"For the summer assignment in the Academy we asked the students to build a maze game.

There were just a view requirements: the students had to own the project and the project management. They could ask for help and guidance from the various teachers.

The game had to be interactive and Hacking should be involved in order to complete the maze. This is the maze Riley came up with.",ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_ASSIGNMENT_RILEY,I learned tons creating the maze. Thanks again Ada for all the help with the game design.,riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_ASSIGNMENT_FABER,"And of course Riley had to feature herself :)

Riley, to do the presentation, I think you also need someone to try out the maze...",faber,,,
SIDETRACK1_ASSIGNMENT_STUDENT,Riiight. *{{user_name}}* do you want to try out my new maze so I can show it off to my teachers?,riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_ASSIGNMENT_ESTELLE,"Riley, we are all very curious to see your final result.",estelle,,,
SIDETRACK1_ASSIGNMENT_SANIEL,Indeed Estelle. Let's dimm the lights and let the show begin.,saniel,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL1_INTRO,"See that *Exit*? That's my dream, to get to that *Exit*. And you can help me get there!",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL1,"Use the FORWARD, UP, and DOWN *Instructions* to move me through these obstacles.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL1_HINT1,"I always run one space to the right, but I can also move UP or DOWN at the same time.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL1_HINT2,Watch out for those *Walls*!,riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_DIED_RESTART,Ooopff. Let's try to avoid these *Walls*!,riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL2,"Hey, another level. You thought you just had to get to the exit! This was just the start...",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL3,I like the music you came up with Riley. All those harmony classes with me paid off in the end.,faber,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL4,"*Pits*? Oh no, how to cross those?",saniel,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL5,"You will have to use the JUMP *Instruction*  to cross the *Pits*!

There's a trick to the JUMP though! JUMP only works if the *Pit* is _directly_ in front of you.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL6,Those pits were not so easy to draw actually. Really hard to create a sense of deepness.,riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_MANUAL7,"You did great Riley, I wish every student is as skilled.",estelle,,,
SIDETRACK1_ROBOTS1,"What are these? *Robot* insects? Insects, really? LOL. Hi! `My.` `Name.` `Is.` `Faber.` `What's.` `Your.` `Name.`",faber,,,
SIDETRACK1_ROBOTS2,"That was helarious, Faber :) Be careful *{{user_name}}*. Study how they move. Keep in mind that when you move, they're moving too.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_ROBOTS3,Watch the movement of the robots carefully to plan your next move. Think about the space they open when they move.,riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_ROBOTS3_HINT1,"These *Robots* only move DOWN, never left or right. Try to use their own rules to get past them.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_ROBOTS3_HINT2,"And when they walk off the bottom, they reappear at the top! So keep your eye out for that!",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_MOREROBOTS,"Another *Robot*! This new type only moves UP, just like the first only moves DOWN. They glow in the direction they're facing!",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO1,"*Robots!* & *Pits!* oh my! Riley, this storyline is great.",ada,hurray,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO1_FELIX,mjau ^ = ^ mjav //\\ ngiyaw /\ ^  miav,felixnet,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO1_FABER,Hold up. Listen. Was that meowing? Is one of Saniel's cats in the maze too?,faber,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO1_ADA,Sounds like it! Riley? The manual controls just totally disappeared. Something must be messing with them!,ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO1_PLOT,"Heh, not to worry. This is all part of my plot. Now the fun part starts.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO1_ESTELLE_REACTION,I see the maze has given a set of *Instructions* already.,estelle,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO1_RILEY,*{{user_name}}* see that PLAY button? Try pushing that.,riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO1_RILEY_HINT1,Press the PLAY button to activate the *Instructions*.,riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO2_INTRO,"You can still move, but now you have to plan all your moves in advance.

It's a new kind of challenge – you just have to give yourself time to think it through.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO2,"After you have the *Instructions* lined up, you press PLAY and that moves you through the maze.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO3,This set of *Instructions* won't cut it! Study the obstacles and put the *Instructions* in a new order.,riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO3_HINT1,You’ll need to drag and drop those *Instructions* to put them in a new order.,riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO3_HINT2,Press PLAY to execute the *Instructions* and get through the level.,riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO3_HINT3,"And keep in mind, once you press PLAY you can no longer change the *Instructions!*",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO3_SUCCESS,Excellent! Riley sailed right through! Thanks to your strategic thinking *{{user_name}}*!,saniel,hurray,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO3_FAILURE,Good try! Let's review the order of the *Instructions* and try again. Do you see a different order to try?,saniel,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO4_SANIEL,"Riley, I like how you have built up the plot to progress from puzzle solving to strategic thinking.",saniel,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO4_RILEY,"Thanks Saniel, your praise means a lot to me.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_ONEJUMP_PRE,"Hey Riley, how's it going in there?",faber,,,
SIDETRACK1_ONEJUMP,"Heh Faber, you know, just chillin' in here!

*{{user_name}}* I hope you are having as much fun as we have.",riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_ONEJUMP_ADA,Look closely. You only have one JUMP. Think strategically!,ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_ONEJUMP_ADA_HINT1,"If you only have one JUMP, then you need to use it on the only pit you can't walk around.",ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_ONEFORWARD,Slowly building up. This time you have two JUMP *Instructions*.,riley,,,
SIDETRACK1_ONEFORWARD_ADA,"Yes, but now there is only one FORWARD Instruction! We have to think carefully where should it go?",ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_ONEFORWARD_ADA_HINT1,"There's one place in this level that you _must_ move forward, not up or down. Use FORWARD there!",ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_SLIDING,"Oh, truly awesome. So many DOWN *Instructions* and Riley need to move FORWARD!

Hmmm, I wonder what happens when you use DOWN when Riley is already at the bottom.

Hope she doesn't fall off. Maybe she'll sort of slide along the bottom edge? Only one way to find out!",faber,,,
SIDETRACK1_WASTEJUMPS,"Think about it, you don't have to have a *Pit* in front of you to use a JUMP.

Maybe you could use a JUMP to go forward? You never know when that will come in handy!",,,,
SIDETRACK1_DRAMA_ADA,This looks familiar.,ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_DRAMA_FABER,"Yeah, just need to power through.",faber,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO5,What’s _that_  *Instruction*? The one at position 3. Something's totally _wrong_ with it!,estelle,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO5_ADA,*{{user_name}}* try pressing PLAY just to see if you can get through anyway.,ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO5_ADA_HINT1,There's no way forward unless we at least try! Press PLAY.,ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO5_FAILURE_SANIEL,"Okay, it was worth trying, but we're not going anywhere with it like that.",saniel,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO5_FAILURE_SANIEL2,"There must be an error, but to be sure we’ll need to see the code.",saniel,,,
SIDETRACK1_AUTO5_FAILURE_ADA,I see where this is going. Maybe we should do a short break first.,ada,,,
SIDETRACK1_SUCCESS,"Yes, this is a really amazing assignment you have put together. Let's meet here again after a short bio break.",faber,hurray,,
SIDETRACK1_ABORT,Come find me later and we can keep working on this!,ada,,,
