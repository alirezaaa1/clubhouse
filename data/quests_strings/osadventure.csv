OSADVENTURE_QUEST_NAME,Building Your Own Adventure!,,,,
OSADVENTURE_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
OSADVENTURE_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Saniel teaches you how to create your own file system, Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style!",,,,
OSADVENTURE_GREET,"Greetings, *{{user_name}}*. So you're back for more, are you? Excellent - I see real potential in you, and I've got just the thing.",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_LAUNCH,Let's launch the Terminal.,saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_1,"Once again, the humble Terminal. Now, you already know that the text on the left is called the *prompt*, which tells you where you are in the filesystem. Let's type a quick `ls` to get our bearings.",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_2,"There's your home directory, well done. You've done solid work learning to navigate the existing filesystem, but did you know you can also create your own filesystem?",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_3,"The filesystem is just a collection of files and folders. Now that you know how to use `nano` to create files, the last piece you're missing is how to create folders, which are also often called *directories*.",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_4,"I mention that last part again, because the command is called `mkdir` - *M*a*k*e *Dir*ectory. I confess I'm surprised the original system designers bothered to make it more than 2 letters long - it feels positively luxurious!",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_5,"Now, let's give that a try - We're going on an adventure today, so let's make a directory called *Adventure* - type `mkdir Adventure`",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_6,"Well done! If you type `ls` again, you can see that there is a new entry called Adventure. To confirm that it is indeed a directory, see if we can `cd` into it. Do you remember how?",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_7,That's right - it's `cd Adventure`. Let's go inside. ,saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_8,"Now, if you look at the prompt, you will see that we are indeed inside `Adventure.` If you're like me, you might have already typed `ls` out of habit to see what's inside this directory. ",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_9,"There's nothing inside, of course, since we just created it. Let's put something inside, though, a text file named *README*. Do you remember how to create a text file?",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_10,"Right - `nano README`, or whatever you want to call it. This file, when read, will welcome your user to the adventure you are about to create. Did you ever read one of those stories where you can choose your own path, and you had to flip back and forth between pages? I still love re-reading the old sci-fi ones, sometimes.",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_11,"Well, that's the type of thing we're going to create, today. For now we can just type ""Welcome to my adventure!"" You can spend as much time as you like coming up with a more detailed introduction later.",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_12,"Remember to save the file before you try to exit (`Ctrl+O`). Hit `Enter` when you see the file name pop up at the bottom, and then you can safely close the file (`Ctrl+X`).",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_13,Let's make sure that worked - type `cat README` to see what the file says.,saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_14,Excellent. Now let's make another file called *castle* - type `nano castle`,saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_15,"Let's make this file say ""Welcome to the castle! The drawbridge lowers as you approach, and you walk hesitantly inside.""",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_16,Make sure to save (`Ctrl+O`) and exit (`Ctrl+X`) when you're done.,saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_17,Now type `ls` - you should see both *README* and *castle* in your *Adventure* directory.,saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_18,"Oh, wait. Fiddlesticks. I actually meant to create a a *directory* named *castle*, not a file. How could the player ""go inside"" the castle if it was a file?",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_19,My mistake - now we'll need to delete this file and create a directory instead.,saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_20,"Now, I'm sure you have deleted files using a graphical interface before - just press *Delete* and the file goes into the ""trash bin"". Well, this system is different. There's no safety net in the Terminal, if you delete something - *ZAP.* Nevertheless, I think it's time that you were given this power. Everyone needs to shoulder this responsibility eventually.",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_21,"The command is `rm`. Used carelessly, this command has been known to trash entire filesystems, so always think very hard before you type it. In our case, here, we know exactly what we want to get rid of, so please type `rm castle`. ",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_22,"Good work, I knew I could trust you with this power. You might have guessed that `rm` stands for *remove*, and if you type `ls` into the command line, you will see that the file has indeed been removed!",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_23,"That file has been cast into the depths of the hard drive, never to return. The space it occupied has been marked as 'free', and any program might overwrite it at any second. Using `rm` on individual files is quite safe, as long as you are very sure of what's in those files. It's when you start trying to delete multiple files that people get into terrible, terrible situations.",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_24,"Ahem, that's enough of my dire warnings,  I think. Back to our adventure! We were going to make a directory called *castle*...",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_25,"So, let's `mkdir castle` and then `cd castle` so we can continue.",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_26,"Now that we're inside *castle*, we can make another *README* file (or whatever you'd like to call it) that welcomes the user to the castle - so, `nano README`",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_27,"Back to what we typed before in that deleted file - ""Welcome to the castle! The drawbridge lowers as you approach, and you walk hesitantly inside. There are two doors in front of you.""",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_28,"This is where things get interesting. We can present the user with two different 'doors' (in this case, directories) which lead to different places. Any ideas on how to do that?",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_29,You might have guessed that we'll do it through 2 more directories - Type `mkdir Door1` and then `mkdir Door2`,saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_30,"Now when the user types `ls` they will see two new directories, and they will have to choose which to go into. Let's `cd Door1` and make something interesting behind it.",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_31,This is where you get to drive the adventure - what do you think is behind Door 1? Use `nano` to create a *README* file that describes what's in this room.,saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_32,"Excellent! Now we want to go back up to the *castle* directory and go into *Door2*. You have been taught how to go back up a directory, correct? Let's have a quick referesher, just in case.",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_33,"You can't type `cd castle`, because *castle* is not inside *Door1*, so you'll need to use the universal command `cd ..` - Note the space between *cd* and *..*  This command will always take you to the ""parent"" directory of the one you're in. For *Door1*, that would be *castle*.",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_34,There you go! We're back in the castle - you can check the prompt and use `ls` just to make sure. Now let's `cd Door2` so we can build out more of our adventure.,saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_35,"Behind Door 2, begin by creating a README file that explains what the user sees. This time, let's have the adventure continue - maybe the user can either turn ""Right"" or ""Left""?",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_36,"After you create the README file, create the new directories (using mkdir) that the user will navigate into next.",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_37,"From here on, the adventure is yours to create! Is your castle magical? Haunted? An elaborate hologram? A complete virtual reality? The only limit is your imagination.",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_38,I've got a few tips to help you along:,saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_39,"1) Remember that you can use ""cd .."" to travel back up one directory.",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_40,"2) If you make a mistake, you can use ""rm."" If you need to remove a directory, you will need type `rm -r DirectoryName`, using the actual name of the directory. Be careful, though. Once it's `rm`ed, that's the end of it.",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_41,"3) It might be helpful to plan out your filesystem by drawing a map. Write ""Adventure"" at the top of your page, and then draw a line down to the word ""castle"". From there, you can draw two lines branching down - one to ""Door1"" and the other to ""Door2"", etc.",saniel,,,
OSADVENTURE_42,"You're quite a talented student, and I'm looking forward to playing your adventure. I'm sure your friends are as well!",saniel,,,
