INTRO_QUESTION,Hi there! Glad you’re here  =^._.^=   Ready to do some more exploring?,riley,,,
INTRO_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes!,,,,quests/quest2-riley-hi
INTRO_WELCOME,Hi {{user_name}}! Welcome to the Clubhouse!,ada,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_FLIPBACK,Nice hack!,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_FLIPBACK_HINT1,I wonder if anything happened to the gate? Click the Flip to Hack button again.,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_GOAL,Beautiful! All new students must solve this puzzle.,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_GOAL_HINT1,Match it by moving the sliders and the doors will unlock.,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_GOAL_HINT2,Keep trying! Move the sliders until the gold wave fits into the groove. ,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_WELCOME,How do you open a locked gate with no key?,ada  ,,quests/ada-intro,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_WELCOME_HINT1,What's that button on the left?,,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_1,"What a ride! We decoded a hidden message, followed a treasure map, and walked away with pirate's booty!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_2,This wouldn't be complete without a way to show off your prize - and I've done a little digging to figure out how.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_3,"Let's get to where we stored your prize - `cd Pictures`, then `ls` to make sure the file's there.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_4,"Great! Let's get this on your screen, now.",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_5,"Look down in the bottom right of the screen, and click your user picture. From that popup menu, click `Settings`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_6,The `Settings` app is where all the internals of the OS are controlled. Look on the left side of the window and click `Background`.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_7,"... and from here, click `Background`, and then the `Pictures` tab. Your treasure should show up!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_8,"Just double-click it, and that'll set it as your background.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_9,"Check it out! Now you've got an brand-new desktop background - anyone asks where you got it, you send 'em to me!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_BAK,❮,,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_END,"Thanks for letting me teach you some cool stuff, {{user_name}} - I had a lot of fun doing it. Keep an eye out for more!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_FWD,❯,,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_LAUNCH,Pop the Terminal open and let's get to it.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_1,Hey {{user_name}}! Ada's always saying we should search out new things to do - so I want to try teaching you some tricks in the *Terminal*!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_10,`ls` is a command that *l*ist*s* all the files and folders in the directory you're in.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_11,"Huh, this is your `home` directory.. but do you remember creating a directory named ""yarnbasket""?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_12,Let's check it out. Type `cd yarnbasket` to *c*hange *d*irectory into it. It's just like double-clicking a folder in the File Manager.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_13,"Now that you're here, type `ls` again to see what's inside.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_14,Ew. Is that a file named.... `mouse`? Felix!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_15,"_Nyan, brrrp? Miao&~^w!_",felixnet,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_16,"`<Felix licks his nose, and vanishes into an air duct.>`",felixnet,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_17,"Well, if that cat won't help us, let's use our own - Type `cat mouse`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_18,"LOL! `cat` reads a file into your terminal window, so that's what was in the file. Nice one, Felix!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_2,"The Terminal is mondo cool, it's where the REAL magic in the OS happens. You know all those scenes in movies where they're hacking into computer systems?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_3,"Yeah, those lines of green text are supposed to look like the Terminal. I'm going to teach you the *real* stuff, though!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_4,Let's get started - I'll pop the Terminal open for you.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_5,"Nice. See that text on the left there? That's called the *prompt* - it's `your user name`, @, `your computer name`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_6,"This means that this terminal is logged into your account, on your computer. But what's after the `:`?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_7,"After the colon (:) is where you are in the filesystem. `~` means your `home` directory, where all your stuff is.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_8,"Now that we know where we are, let's see what's here. ",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_9,Type `ls` into the Terminal then hit *Enter*.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_BAK,❮,,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_END,"Hey, that was fun! You learned *ls*, *cd*, and *cat* - and I've got much more planned for next time!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_FWD,❯,,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_1,"I'm so excited, we're on the trail of something cool, I know it. Let's take another look at that map.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_10,"To move a file, we need to use the *m*o*v*e command... `mv`. ",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_11,"Like *grep*, *mv* needs some extra info - It needs the file you want move, then the place you want to move it.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_12,So... `mv treasure.png ∼/Pictures/` That moves it into your Pictures folder. (`∼` means your home directory),riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_2,Do `cat savedresult` (or whatever you named your file last time).,riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_3,"Like I said, this looks like a list of directories. Let's follow the trail...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_4,"You can do this 2 ways - either do `cd <the first directory>`, `cd <the second directory>` and so on, or...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_5,"... you can string them together - `cd all/strung/together/like/this`. Your choice, they'll both get us where we want to go.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_6,"Now that you're at the end, let's `ls`...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_7,Sweet! Treasure! We found it!,riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_8,"Haha! I feel like a pirate digging up buried treasure. Yarr, matey! Avast!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_9,"Like any pirate, we need to get our loot back onto the ship - or, in your case, your home directory.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_BAK,❮,,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_END,"Great job! For the final lesson, I have something special planned...",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_FWD,❯,,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_LAUNCH,Open up the Terminal and let's roll out!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_1,"Ready to dive back into the Terminal? I hope so, because there's no brakes on this knowledge train, woo woo!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_10,"There's one last trick, though - see, normally, `grep` looks for a group of letters, but we actually want everything that's NOT those letters. ",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_11,"So we have to add `-v`, for in*v*ert - that tells `grep` to look for stuff that's NOT the letters we put in.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_12,"Whew! Complicated! Let's put it together - don't hit enter until the very end. `grep`, the command, `-v` to invert...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_13,"`meow`, the word that we want to remove, `treasuremeowp`, the file we're working on...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_14,"...Then `> savedresult` so we can save the result into whatever you want to name the file. I'm going to call it `savedresult`, though.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_15,"All together, that's `grep -v meow treasuremeowp > savedresult`. Are you sweating? I think my brain needs a sports drink...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_16,"Now the moment of truth - hit *enter*. If you see nothing, that means no errors... then you can `cat savedresult` to see what we got.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_17,"Interesting. Those forward-slashes mean this is a list of directories. It WAS a treasure map, and it's leading us into the file system!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTMAP_2,"Ok, that was kinda corny, but I'm getting a big kick out of this. I hope you're having fun too!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_3,"Last time, we `cat`ed a ""mouse"" into the terminal. That's cool, but there was another file I wanted to look at in `yarnbasket`. So, `cd yarnbasket` to change directory...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_4,"...And as usual, `ls` to see what we've got in here.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_5,There we go  - I was interested in `treasuremeowp` - it's got treasure in the name! Let's read it - `cat treasuremeowp`.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_6,"Ok, so that's totally unreadable. Reminds me a lot of my last big essay after Felix was done with it... But! Ada gave me a tip after that happened.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_7,"She told me that if I ever want to search a file to find words, I can use `grep`. It's a program that goes through files and finds a group of letters.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_8,"But normally, `grep` just does its work and then finishes. If we want to see what it did, we need to tell it to save its work.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_9,"To get `grep` to save its output, we use `>` - that tells `grep` ""Send your result over here -->"". Then we add a filename, and that saves the result!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_BAK,❮,,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_END,We'll tackle that path in the next part - I'm excited to see what we'll find!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_FWD,❯,,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_LAUNCH,Launch the Terminal and let's get going!,riley,,,
T2GAME8_GREET1,"This game doesn't have any data associated with it yet. You can still play it, though.",,,,
T2LAUNCHER_BEGIN,We are about to launch the game. I hope you like it.,ada,,,
T2LAUNCHER_END,Enjoy the game. See you later!,ada,,,
T2LAUNCHER_INSTALL,First you will need to install the T2 game. Come back later!,ada,,,
