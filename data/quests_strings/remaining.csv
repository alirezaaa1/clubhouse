HTMLINTRO2_1,"Hey again! This lesson's going to go a little deeper, *{{user_name}}*...",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_10,"Find another `<p>` tag and make *that* text orange, or red.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_11,I wonder what happens if you try the same logic with an `<h1>` or `<h2>` tag? Try making one of those purple.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_12,"If you did it right, it should look something like `<h1 style=""color:purple"">`.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_13,Nice. But what if you wanted to use that shade of green that grass gets when it's almost summer but not quite?,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_14,"That's probably not a color your web browser understands, so we need a more specific way to express color.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_15,"Fortunately, your web brower understands something called *hex color* - a way of expressing color using 6-digit numbers.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_16,Here's an example hex color - #FF3380,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_17,"Notice the letters in there - Hex color uses 1 to 9, then A B C D E F. Think of it as a way of getting 2 digit numbers without using 2 digits.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_18,"The 3 groups of 2 numbers express how much red, green, and blue you need to make that color.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_19,"#FF3300 means *tons* of red, a little green, and no blue at all.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_2,First things first - let's get back to that web page previewer.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_20,"To use a hex color in your webpage, just replace one of your color words with a hex code - like #3642BF, maybe.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_21,"If you edited a `<p>` tag, it would be `<p style=""color:#3642BF"">`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_22,Cool! Try another color!,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_23,"If you don't want to just guess at color shades, you can try this webpage: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_3,"As before, if it's not opening, switch over to Chrome. You can hold `Alt` and press `Tab` to cycle through active programs, or look at the bottom of the screen.",riley,,,

HTMLINTRO2_5,"Here's a fun fact - Just based on our last lesson, you already know enough to make your own webpage!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_6,"If you did, though, all you'd have is boring black text on a white background. Let's spice that up a little...",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_7,"Find an opening `<p>` tag in your code, and add this after the *p* - `style=”color:blue”`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_8,"If you did it correctly, the tag will look like this `<p style=""color:blue"">`, and your text will be blue!",riley,,,

OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_1,Hey *{{user_name}}*! Ada's always saying we should search out new things to do - so I want to try teaching you some tricks in the *Terminal*!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_10,"Right now, yours should say `~` (tilde), which means we're in your `home` directory, where all your stuff is.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_11,"So what's a *file system*? Bascially it's like a big group of folders, and some of them contain more folders inside them, and so on...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_12,"You might also hear these folders called *directories*, sometimes.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_13,"To see what's around you in the current directory, you use `ls` (that's lower-case L, lower-case S)",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_14,`ls` is a command that *lists* everything in the directory you're in. It's like looking around in a room.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_15,Type `ls` into the Terminal then hit *Enter*.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_16,"Cool! That should have shown you a list of items, then given you a new prompt.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_17,"Whenever you see a new, empty prompt, the Terminal is ready for another command.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_18,"So, if you have already saved any files in your home directory, you'll see them here.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_19,"Wait, did you create a directory named `yarnbasket`? What's that doing here?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_2,"The Terminal is mondo cool, it's where the REAL magic in the OS happens. You know those scenes in movies where they hack into computer systems?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_20,Let's check it out. To go into another folder (or directory) we need to use the `cd` command.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_21,"`cd` stands for *change directory*. You need to tell `cd` where to go - so let's type `cd yarnbasket`, then hit *enter*",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_22,"Your prompt should change - It should say `yarnbasket`, since you typed in `cd yarnbasket`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_23,"Now that you're inside this folder, type `ls` again to see what's inside.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_24,"Is that a file named.... *mouse*? Ew, Felix!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_25,"_Nyan, brrrp? Miao&^w!_",felixnet,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_26,"`<Felix licks his nose, and vanishes into an air duct.>`",felixnet,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_27,"I love that cat, but he drives me nuts sometimes. He never does anything when you need him to!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_28,"Well, if Felix won't help us, we'll just have to use a different cat.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_29,"The program `cat` helps you open files - it shows their data on the screen, right in the terminal.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_3,"That's *supposed* to look like the Terminal. I'm going to teach you the *real* stuff, though!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_30,You can actually `cat` any file - but only text files will be anything you can read. ,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_31,Let's check out that file - type `cat mouse` to `cat` the file named *mouse*.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_32,LOL! Looks like Felix played one of his pranks on us... Just like a real cat.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_33,"That was fun! You learned *ls*, *cd*, and *cat* - and I've got much more planned for next time!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_34,Catch you later!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_4,"Just a couple things before we start - when I do text like *this*, it's important.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_5,Text `like this` is a command - something you could type into the terminal.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_6,So if I say *don't* type `destroyallfiles`... hehehe.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_7,Let's get started - I'll open the Terminal open for you.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_8,"Nice. See that text on the left there? That's called the *prompt* - it's `your user name`, @, `your computer name`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_9,"After the colon (`:`) is where you are in the file system. It's a ""you are here"" for the filesystem.",riley,,,

OSONESHOTFOLLOW_1,"I'm so excited - We're on the trail of something cool, I know it. Let's take another look at that map.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_10,"I feel like a pirate digging up buried treasure. Yarr, matey! Avast!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_11,"Like any pirate, we need to get our loot back onto the ship - or, in your case, your home directory.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_12,"To move a file, we need to use the *move* command... `mv`. ",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_13,"`mv` needs the file you want to move, and where you want it to go.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_14,Let's tell `mv` to move this file by directly telling it where to move to.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_15,"So, that's `mv treasure.jpg ∼/Pictures/`...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_16,... Move `treasure.jpg` into `∼/Pictures`.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_17,"Great job! If you're wondering how I know all the ways to use these commands, it's because there's a manual you can read!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_18,"There's a command you can use called `man` - you do `man` and then any other command, and it'll tell you how to use it.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_19,"So, for example, try `man mv`. Press `q` to quit the manual when you're done.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_2,"If you're not in `yarnbasket`, let's get back in there - `cd yarnbasket`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_3,"Let's look at your results from last time - if you forgot the file you saved, do `ls` and try to find it.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_4,Now you can `cat results` (or whatever you named your file).,riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_5,"Like I said last time, this looks like a list of directories. Let's follow the trail...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_6,"You can do this 2 ways - either `cd <the first directory>`, `cd <the second directory>` and so on, or...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_7,"... you can string them together - `cd all/strung/together/like/this`. Your choice, they'll both get us where we want to go.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_8,"Now that you're at the end, let's `ls`...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_9,Is that a file named `treasure`? Haha! We found it!,riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_BAK,❮,,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_END,Whew. I think that's enough for the moment! I have something special for your final lesson...,riley,,,

OSONESHOTFOLLOW_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn to follow a map through your computer's file system, move files, and access program manuals. (Part 3 of 4)",,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_1,"Ready to dive back into the Terminal? I hope so, because there's no brakes on this knowledge train, woo woo!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_10,"Wait, though - Ada gave me a tip after that happened. She told me there was a way to search a file...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_11,It's a little program called `grep` - Ada told me to think of it like a little monster that sifts through files.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_12,"`grep` is like `cat`- it needs a file to work on. Unlike `cat`, it also needs something to look for.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_13,"Let's try a quick example - use `grep` to look for ""cat"" in `mouse`, the file from last time.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_14,"That's `grep cat mouse` - `grep`, the thing we want it to look for, then the file we want to look in.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_15,"And there we go - one line comes back, because that's the only line where ""cat"" shows up.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_16,"So, that works. But what if there's a lot of results? We might want to save it in a file, so we can look at it later.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_17,"To get `grep` to save its output, we use `>`. That tells `grep` ""Send your result that-a-way ->"".",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_18,"On the other side of the `>`, we put the name of the file we want to use. So let's combine that with the last thing we did...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_19,"`grep cat mouse > myfile` - Find ""cat"" in `mouse` and save it in `myfile`",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_2,"Ok, that was kinda corny, but I'm getting a big kick out of this. I hope you're having fun too!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_20,Now you can `cat myfile`... and you should see the same thing you saw when you ran `grep` the first time!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_21,We're almost there - is your brain all tangled up yet? I hope *knot*! :D,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_22,"The last piece of our puzzle is a tough one - we've used `grep`, but so far we've had to tell it what to look for.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_23,"We know that `treasuremeowp` has a ton of ""meow"" in it, but we want everything that *isn't* that.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_24,"Good thing `grep` has an option we can use to help! `-v`, for *invert*. It takes what we ask for and gives back everything *else* instead.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_25,"These options go right after `grep`, but before the search text or file name - like setting a drill to forward or reverse, first.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_26,Let's try that on our old standby - `grep -v cat mouse`.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_27,"See? We got all the lines *except* the ones with ""cat"". Are you ready for the final step?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_28,"Try to figure it out yourself first - we want to `grep`, inverted (`-v`), looking for ""meow"", in `treasuremeowp`, sending it to a file.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_29,"Got it? If your brain feels like it's sweating, you're doing great!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_3,"Last time, we `cat`ed a ""mouse"" into the terminal. That's cool, but there was another file I wanted to look at.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_30,"All together, that's `grep -v meow treasuremeowp > results`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_31,"Now the moment of truth - hit *enter*. If you see nothing, that means no errors... then you can `cat results` to see what we got.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_32,Whoo. I think my brain needs a sports drink...,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_33,Hmm... another puzzle! Those forward-slashes might mean this is a list of directories...,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_34,"I was right! This *was* a treasure map, and it's leading us deeper into the file system!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTMAP_4,"So, check your prompt - are you still in `yarnbasket`? If not, let's `cd yarnbasket` to get in there.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_5,"...And now, let's `ls` to see what we've got.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_6,See that file named `treasuremeowp`? That was what I was looking for - it's got treasure in the name!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_7,Let's see if we can read it - think back to last lesson.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_8,"Ok, so - `cat treasuremeowp` ... let's see what it says.",riley,,,
