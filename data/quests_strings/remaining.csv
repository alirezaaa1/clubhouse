BONUSROUND_LEVELS6_B,"Look at this weird level we have to beat. All the <b>Instructions</b> are missing! And the Units panel isn't even available, nice. ",,,,

BONUSROUND_LEVELS6_B_HINT2,"Let's just try a solution, see how far we get, then tweak our solution based on what we observe, and then try again!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS6_B_HINT3,"It's useful to remember that you can type <b>Instructions</b> in any order, then flip back over rearrange them.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS6_B_HINT4,"I bet there's more than one way through this level. But pushing that middle block in column 2 seems like one approach. 

We may have to push it over and over.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7,"Oh cool, in this level we can use Unit editing AND <b>Instruction</b>  editing! It should be a breeze.

Wait, what? Are you seeing what I'm seeing? There's no way through a double thick column of <b>Walls</b>, is there? 

Not even <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">push</span></tt> can solve THAT. What are we going to do?",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_B,Oh! Here it is! Guess what? I just found the Level Editing key! Just what we've been searching for! We did it!,,hurray,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_FLIP,"Flip the app around, then use the key to unlock the Level Editing panel!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_LEVELCODE1,"Amazing! Exactly what I wanted! This is the code that creates this level!

See <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">add (pit, 1, 2);</span></tt>? That's what creates the <b>Pit</b> right near the beginning. This code says: add a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">pit</span></tt> at coordinate (1,2).

Coordinate (1,2) means x = 1, y = 2. X is the column, so that's why the pit appears in column 1.

Y = 2 is for the row. The top row is y = 0, and the bottom row is y = 4. We hackers like to start counting from 0 instead of 1.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_LEVELCODE2,"If we want to move that <b>Pit</b> out of our way, we can give it a new coordinate.

Try changing the coordinate to something like x = 1, y = 4 by editing the code to say <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">add (pit, 1, 4);</span></tt>",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_LEVELCODE3,"But we really need to do is fix the problem of two columns of <b>Walls</b> in a row!

BONUSROUND_LEVELS7_LEVELCODE3_HINT3,"Depending on how you edit the level, you MAY also need to edit <b>Instructions</b> so you can beat it.",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS8,I LOVE editing the level! Remember how hard this robot dance party was? Now we can beat it EASY.,,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS8_HINT1,"Go the Level hacking panel and edit the code! Heck, you can just delete EVERY <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">add()</span></tt> function if you want!",,,,
BONUSROUND_LEVELS8_HINT2,"Don't delete <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">rileyPosition = 2;</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">goalPosition = 2;</span></tt> though.

Try increasing the radius for ""species 0"" by clicking on the + button. Did you catch how the code changed when you did that? ",,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_EXPLANATION1_HINT1,"Okay, now change the radius for the orange ball pressing on the + button next to Radius.",,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_EXPLANATION2,Great. Now let's try it the other way. Go to the coding panel and change the radius. See how it changes in the user interface too? ,,,,

See you at the Clubhouse!",,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_EXPLANATION,"One of the cool things about code is that you're not tied to someone else's idea. You can let your imagination run wild.

So, we know that if you set some gravity on an object, it falls down, right? But what happens if you set the gravity negative? Try it!",,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_EXPLANATION_HINT1,Set the gravity for the orange ball negative.,,,,
FIZZICSCODE2_EXPLANATION_HINT2,Set species[0].gravity to -30.,,,,

FIZZICSINTRO_LEVEL1_HINT1,Click the orange ball to activate the slingshot. Pull back on it and then release it. ,,,,
FIZZICSINTRO_LEVEL1_HINT2,To win the level you have to fling all the orange balls against the goal.,,,,

FIZZICSKEY_ABORT,"Come back when you're ready! Until then, Riley's stuck inside the maze! ",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LAUNCH,Launch Fizzics!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1,"Okay, so when I stashed the key in these early levels, Fizzics didn't even have a hacking panel.

So you're not going to be able to use some of the solutions you've used before. You'll have to improvise. 

it's fun to try out some clunkier solutions sometimes. Let's get started. It's easier to demonstrate than explain.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_B,"Right now this level is in suspended animation. It's been inactive for so long. 

Okay, so just let me make a few adjustments over here to get everything moving again. 

Ready?",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_C,"Okay! So that didn't work. We need get the orange ball to touch the goal, 

See how there's no <b>Fling</b> tool and no <b>Drag</b> tool? All you have is the <b>Add</b> tool. 

And you can only <b>Add</b> boulders! That's how ancient it is!",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_FAIL,"Hmmm... guess that configuration wasn't quite right. 

Nothing to do but try it again with a modified solution.",saniel,,,

Don't get TOO excited, though. We have a ways to go, still.",saniel,hurray,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_GO,Okay here we go!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_Q1,"Great, I'll take the level out of suspended animation. 

Just a couple more questions. What should the <b>Friction</b> on the orange ball be?",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_Q1_A1,Low.,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_Q1_A2,None!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_Q2,And how bouncy should the orange ball be?,saniel,,,

FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_READY,"Use the <b>Add</b> tool to <b>Add</b> boulders until you think the level is in a good configuration. 

Tell me when you're ready.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS1_READY_ACCEPT,I'm ready!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2,"Here's the next level. We have to get through all six!

This one is very much like the last, except the orange ball isn't bouncy.

I can control a couple things from here. I can make the orange ball and spikey things repel each other. 

And I can give the orange ball some friction.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_FAIL,"Curses! Well, let's try adding different boulders, or perhaps we can add different settings to the available parameters?",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_FINISH,Sensational! I'm pleased to see your skill and acumen at this task.,saniel,hurray,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_GO,Let's try it out!,saniel,,,

Tell me when you're ready.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS2_READY_ACCEPT,I'm ready!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3,"On this level, the orange ball can either have <b>positive</b> or <b>negative</b> <b>Gravity</b>. 

With negative <b>Gravity</b> intstead of dropping downwards, the ball floats upwards. 

Also note the two goals are overlapping. As soon as the level starts, they will fly away from each other!

Also, you'll see that the diamonds tend to clump together. That's because of their <b>Attraction</b> setting!",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS3_FAIL,"Blast. Well it's rare to get something right without trying a few times. 

So-called failure can be a great teacher! Let's attempt it again.",saniel,,,

FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4,"This is another level in which the goal is mobile. That boulder is about to send it flying! 

Here's a nice thing though. All the diamonds are attracted to the orange ball! Very handy!

Let's see... I can increase the <b>Gravity</b> settings for the goal and the diamonds, if you'd like.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_FAIL,"What a bother. But no worries, let's try again.",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_FINISH,You never fail to impress! Just two more levels to go!,saniel,hurray,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_GO,Let's see how that worked!,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q1,Do you want the goal object to have any <b>Gravity</b>?,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q1_A1,Yes,saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS4_Q1_A2,No,saniel,,,

That should be fun. Watch out, though, it's VERY bouncy!

I can give the goal <b>Gravity</b> if you'd like. Hmmm look at this! I can also make the diamonds HUGE!",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_FAIL,Alas! Well it was an excellent attempt. Let's get back in and try again.,saniel,talk_anger,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_FINISH,"Nailed it! Excellent, we're ready for the final level! We'll recover that key soon enough!",saniel,,,
FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS5_GO,Here we go!,saniel,,,

FIZZICSKEY_LEVELS6,"The key is here! We just need to beat the level! This one is peculiar however.

The goal has normal gravity. But the orange ball has NEGATIVE <b>Gravity</b>. 

I can increase its negative <b>Gravity</b> to cause it to fall upwards with greater force.

LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT2,"Aha! Look at the letters in the files. They've changed. They've also changed in <b>Cipher Output</b>, as well. Interesting!

This confirms my theory. This is encoded with a rotational cipher, where the letters are shifted over in the alphabet.

For example, if you take the word <b>CAT</b> and shift all the letters over one, you get <b>DBU</b>. ",estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT2_ADA,"Maybe the page holds some clues? What can we still see clearly? Just for fun, try counting the cat tails! ",ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT3,"This looks like it might be a long, difficult process. Any tips, Estelle?",ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT3_HINT1,"Ciphers like this one only change letters, not where letters appear in words. I think I see some patterns in the data.",estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT3_HINT2,"Think about it. <b>OCZ</b> appears many times. 

So, if we compare <b>OCZ</b> to a common 3-letter word like <b>THE</b>, that will actually tell us alot!",estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT3_HINT3,"Enter <b>OCZ</b> into <b>Cipher Input</b> and try different numbers until you get <b>THE</b> in <b>Cipher Output</b>. 

Solving the cipher for OCZ will help you solve the whole cipher!",estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT_HINT1,Try any number. Even the wrong guess will give us more information about what we're working with. ,estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT_HINT2,"Once you try a number, Flip back to see what effect it has on the text.",estelle,,,

LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION2,"Tiiiiight! I knew you'd be able to help us with this, Estelle! Thank you!",faber,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION3,"Amazing. Thank you, Estelle. What does this new instruction do?",ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION4,"It does just what it says. You can use it to move a <b>Wall</b> that's blocking you. 

Riley can use it in <b>Sidetrack</b> to push <b>Walls</b> out of her way. It’s going to be essential in getting her past obstacles.",estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION5,"Well, this is getting very interesting! Why was there a note about Saniel's AI trap in Leviathan's code sketchbooks?",ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION6,"Ada, I think that's something you're going to have to ask Saniel about! ",estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_QUESTION,"Hey there, would you like to join me in looking at my research files?",ada,,,

LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE,"Go to the Beam tab. Look at the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">updateBeam()</span></tt> function. This is different from the other enemies we've seen.

See those <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if</span></tt> statements? It's checking if <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">playerShip.position.y</span></tt> is higher and moving up, or lower and moving down.

So it's tracking the player! Change the code so the enemy still moves some but it's easier to beat the level.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT1,What if we reverse the effect?,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT2,"So when the player is higher than the enemy, the enemy moves down and the other way around.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT3,"So instead of subtracting 5, add 5. Also flip the other statement.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT4,"So <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if (playerShip.position.y &lt; enemy.position.y) enemy.position.y = enemy.position.y + 5;</span></tt>",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_EXPLAIN,"All right. So right now the <b>beam</b> moves towards the player relentlessly. It's impossible to beat.

Let's see if you can fix it so you can beat this level. Go to the coding panel.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_FAILED,"If that's too difficult, go back to the code and fix the enemy to make it move away from you.",,,,

LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_LAUNCH_HINT1,Lightspeed! ,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_MOVING,Cool. We got the enemies moving. Now try to beat the level. Let's see if you made it easy enough...,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_NOENEMIES,Weird. I don't see any enemies anymore. Did you change something? Let's fix it.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_NOTMOVING,They're not moving at all. Something must be wrong. Let's check.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_PLAYTEST,Let's see if the enemies are moving correctly...,,,,

LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_ABORT,"Go if you must, but I do hope you'll check back later.  ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_ABOUTTOPLAY,Ready. Let's play!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_ABOUTTOPLAY_HINT1,Click the trusty <b>Restart</b> button.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_CODE,"All right, now we need to give it everything. Let's spawn every enemy and Power-up in this level.

Click on the Spawn tab and look at the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">spawnEnemy()</span></tt> function.

Let's change it so it randomly spawns any of the 4 enemies: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">asteroid</span></tt>, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">spinner</span></tt>, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">squid</span></tt> or <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">beam</span></tt>. I'm ready to give you hints.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_CODE_HINT1,"See where we return <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">asteroid</span></tt>? Instead we'll return by using the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">pickOne()</span></tt> function.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_CODE_HINT2,"Inside the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">pickOne()</span></tt> we will list the 4 enemies, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">asteroid, spinner, squid, beam</span></tt>.",,,,

LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_END,This is auspicious indeed! I'm going to head to the Clubhouse and see how this work! See you there. ,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_EXPLAIN,"Here we are. You'll have to create and beat the final level with every monster and every upgrade.

Press the Flip button to go to the code.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_FINISHLEVEL,Excellent. You've got all 4 enemies. Now finish the level. That's how we'll find that second fob!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_LAUNCH,We need to beat the final level in Lightspeed. Launch it now.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_NOTFOUR,I don't see all 4 enemies. Let's go back and check.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_PLAYTEST,You should get all 4 enemies in this level.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_PLAY_AGAIN,Let's try this level again.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT1,Click ye olde <b>Restart. button</b> ,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_QUESTION,We're almost there! One more level! Ready to find the second access fob?,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFINAL_SUCCESS,"Well done! I knew you could get us here! And, just as we'd hoped, here's the fob. ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_ABORT,Stop by again sometime soon!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_ABOUTTOPLAY,"OK, let's try it now.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_CODE,"Click on the Spawn tab. See the function called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">spawnEnemy()</span></tt>? That's where we create the asteroids.

There you can change the scale to something smaller so the level becomes playable again.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_CODE_HINT1,"See that <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">scale: 150</span></tt>? Change that number to something smaller like 50.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_CODE_HINT2,Make sure to play Level 3 and beat it to see if your solution works correctly.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_EXPLANATION,Play Level 3 and be on the lookout for anything unusual.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_EXPLANATION2,"Someone made those asteroids way too big! You'll need to get in there and adjust that. 

Just like before, you'll have to hack the app to fix it. But this time you'll be using code to do it.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_EXPLANATION2_HINT1,Press the Flip button.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_LAUNCH,"Most excellent. So as Ada told you, in Lightspeed you're going be able to add some new levels. 

But for now we've got an issue with Level 3 we'd like you to fix. Go ahead and launch Lightspeed now, please.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_PLAYTEST,"If that worked, the asteroids should be smaller. Can you beat this level?",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_PLAYTEST_HINT1,"If you can't beat it, go back to the code panel and try making it even smaller.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_QUESTION,Ready for some more coding in Lightspeed? ,saniel,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Definitely.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_SUCCESS,Excellent. That'll do it. We've got a few more things to fix. Come find me when you're ready for more coding!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_ABORT,Done so soon? Come back to the Clubhouse whenever you want to try again.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_ABOUTTOPLAY,Go ahead and test your code by playing Level 4.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE,"Click on the Spawn tab again. The <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">spawnEnemy()</span></tt> function is returning null! No wonder there are no asteroids.

Try changing it to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">return asteroid;</span></tt> and running Level 4. What do you think will happen?",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2,"An asteroid every second is more like what we're going for. There are thirty ticks per second. 

We have a variable called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ticksSinceSpawn</span></tt>, which goes up once every tick. Let's spawn it every 30 ticks.

See that line that says <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if (ticksSinceSpawn &gt; 0)</span></tt>? That executes the line below whenever <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ticksSinceSpawn</span></tt> is greater than zero.

Let's change that 0 to 30 and we'll get one asteroid about every second.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2_HINT1,"The condition would be <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ticksSinceSpawn &gt; 30</span></tt>",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2_HINT2,"The code should be <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if (ticksSinceSpawn &gt; 30) { return asteroid; }</span></tt>",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2_HINT3,Go back to the game when you're ready and test it out.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE_HINT1,Don't forget the semicolon at the end.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE_HINT2,"When it looks good, press the Flip button again and try your level.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_EXPLANATION,"Level 4 is somehow quite sparse! We could really use some more asteroids!

Go ahead and flip to hack just as we did before.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_FINISHLEVEL,"Fantastic. Nice work spawning those asteroids! Now, go back in there and beat the level!",,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_LAUNCH,All right. Let's go to Lightspeed again.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_NOENEMIES,Hmmm. I don't see any enemies yet. Let's go back and look at the spawn code again.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_PLAYTEST,Let's see those asteroids now.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_QUESTION,We've got our work cut out for us on Lightspeed.,saniel,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_QUEST_ACCEPT,"Okay, let's get on it!",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_SUCCESS,Smart work there! Clearly you're ready for something more challenging. Stop by the Clubhouse for more.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_TOOMANY,"Leaping Antelopes! That's a LOT of asteroids. So many in fact that you blew up the limit.

It turns out the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">spawnEnemy()</span></tt> function gets called every tick (about 30 times per second!).

So you're creating 30 asteroids per second! Let's go back and fix it.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDINTRO_ABORT,"No prob, we'll try again later. ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDINTRO_END,Come get me in the Clubhouse and we'll go over the next steps.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDINTRO_EXPLANATION,"The Conservatory Director, Estelle, designed this as a simulation exercise in her aerospace engineering days. 

Now we use it for training. You'll get to design your own levels. Can't wait to see what you do with it! 
",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDINTRO_FIVE,5 more to go!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDINTRO_GOAL,The goal of Lightspeed is very simple: Pick up 10 astronauts with your ship and avoid crashing into anything.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDINTRO_LAUNCH,"We're all still heads down in this data corruption. Such a mess! Enough of that for now. 

You can help us by sharpening your coding skills! And this game will help you do that. it's called Lightspeed.

Go ahead and launch it from the desktop. Do you see it there? 
",,,,quests/quest2-ada-hi
LIGHTSPEEDINTRO_ONE,That's it! Continue rescuing astronauts like that.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDINTRO_QUESTION,"So nice to see you again! I've got a new game for you to work on. Want to try it?
",ada,,,quests/quest2-ada-hi
LIGHTSPEEDINTRO_QUEST_ACCEPT,Of course!,,,,quests/quest2-ada-hi
LIGHTSPEEDINTRO_SUCCESS,"Quick work! Now we'll need your help with the other levels.

I'm going to give you the Lightspeed Controls Key. This will open up new coding options for you!",,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_ABORT,No problem. Come back when you're ready.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LAUNCH,First let's launch <b>Lightspeed</b>.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LAUNCH_HINT1,Click on the <b>Lightspeed</b> icon on the desktop.        ,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS1,"A good strategy is just to try out each level first so you can see the nature of the challenge it poses.

Then when you flip to the <b>Toolbox</b>, I'll be standing by to help. Maybe we can improve this Squid situation!",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS1_HINT1,Play this level and see what approach it requires. Then click the <b>Flip</b> button and get in there!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS2,"Good work! One level down, two to go! See what's up with this level. Then flip to hack.",,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS2_HINT1,"Wow, the astronauts are tiny and they zoom super fast! Maybe a Power-Up can attract them?",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS3,Last level! Almost there! The key waits for you when you win this level!,,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS3_HINT1,That's a whole lot of enemies! Maybe we can change how they Spawn.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELSINTRO,"The next three levels are OLD ones, so the challenges are weird! But the key we need is at the end.

Aaaand, some of the <b>Topics</b> aren't available! When you do see a <b>Topic</b>, jump on your chance to hack the level! ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_ASTEROID,The code in these <b>Topics</b> changes the behaviors of an enemy type. This <b>Topic</b> works for Asteroids.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_ASTEROID_HINT1,"Do you see where it says <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">enemy.position.y</span></tt>? That tells the Asteroid where to be on the screen.

If <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">enemy.position.y</span></tt> is 0, that's the bottom of the screen. Higher numbers are towards the top.

This code gets called every instant to tell the Asteroid what new screen position it should have.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_BEAM,The code in these <b>Topics</b>  changes the behaviors of an enemy type. This <b>Topic</b> works for Beams.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_BEAM_HINT1,"Do you see where it says <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">enemy.position.y</span></tt>? That tells the Beam where to be on the screen.

If <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">enemy.position.y</span></tt> is 0, that means it's at the bottom of the screen. Higher numbers are towards the top.

This code gets called every instant to tell the Beam what new screen position it should have.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_GAME,"You change the size of your ship and the astronauts in this <b>Topic</b>!

You can also change the speed and appearance of your ship.

This is a really handy <b>Topic</b>, because it has some other powerful parameters too.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_LOCKED,This <b>Topic</b> isn't available on this level!  How can you solve it with another <b>Topic</b>?,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_POWERUPS,"The code in this <b>Topic</b> changes what special powers you get when you collide with a Power-Up.

Power-Ups make it easier to pick up astronauts, or they can blow up enemies. Useful stuff like that!",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_POWERUPS_HINT1,"Look for <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if</span></tt> statements, which check to see if something is either true or false.

For example <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if (powerUpType === blowup)</span></tt> tests to see if <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">powerUpType</span></tt> equals blowup. It can be true or false.

<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">(powerUpType === blowup)</span></tt> is called a condition. The code after it only happens if the condition is true.

For example, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if (powerUpType === blowup) blowUpEnemies();</span></tt> means if the condition is true, then <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">blowUpEnemies();</span></tt>",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_POWERUPS_HINT2,"One thing you could do is change which effect happens for each possible value of <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">powerUpType</span></tt>.

<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ship.attractTimer = 5;</span></tt> is the code which makes the ship attract astronauts from further away.

You could replace the code that's called after each condition with that code.

As just ONE example, you could delete <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ship.shrinkTimer = 5;</span></tt> and replace it with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ship.attractTimer = 5;</span></tt>.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_POWERUPS_HINT3,"You can shortcut conditions entirely by replacing them with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if (true)</span></tt> or <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if (false)</span></tt>.

If you only want ONE kind of effect to happen, no matter which Power-up you hit, that's a way to do it.

You could replace every condition with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">(true)</span></tt> or <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">(false)</span></tt>, depending on what you want to accomplish.

Don't be afraid if you mess things up. You can just hit the <b>reset all</b> button!",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPAWN,"This is the Spawn <b>Topic</b>, and it controls when enemies and Power-Ups appear. It's really powerful!

Let's see, what kind of changes can you make here? ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPAWN_HINT1,"See where it says <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">return</span></tt> and then an enemy type like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">asteroid</span></tt>? That's the type of enemy that gets spawned.

So you could change the word after <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">return</span></tt> to change which enemy type appears.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPAWN_HINT2,"Or sometimes, you'll see an <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if</span></tt> statement, which checks to see if something's true or not.

For example <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if (r === 2) return spinner;</span></tt> tests to see if r equals 2, and if it does, that's true, so it <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">return</span></tt>s spinner. 

The part that says <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">(r === 2)</span></tt> is called the <i>condition</i>. You could change it, like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if (r ===</span></tt> some other number maybe.

Or you can just change it to say <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if (true)</span></tt> or <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if (false)</span></tt> which will automatically pass or fail the condition test.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPINNER,The code in these <b>Topics</b>  changes the behaviors of an enemy type. This <b>Topic</b> works for Spinners.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPINNER_HINT1,"Do you see where it says <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">enemy.position.y</span></tt>? That tells the Spinner where to be on the screen.

If <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">enemy.position.y</span></tt> is 0, that's the bottom of the screen. Higher numbers are towards the top.

This code gets called every instant to tell the Spinner what new screen position it should have.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SQUID,"The code in these <b>Topics</b> creates behaviors for an enemy type. This <b>Topic</b> works for Squids.

If you're having problems with Squid enemies, maybe you can fix it here.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SQUID_HINT1,"Do you see where it says <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">enemy.position.y</span></tt>? That tells the Squid where to be on the screen.

If <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">enemy.position.y</span></tt> is 0, that's the bottom of the screen. Higher numbers are towards the top.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SQUID_HINT2,"This code gets called every instant to tell the Squid what new screen position it should have.

If it says <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">enemy.position.y = enemy.position.y + 0;</span></tt> that means set the new position to the current position.

It actually says <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">+ 0</span></tt> but when you add zero to something the number doesn't change.

And with no change, the Squid's position stays the same as it was.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SQUID_HINT3,"So you can tell every Squid where to be on the screen every instant! What can you do with that?

They would move upwards with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">enemy.position.y = enemy.position.y + 5;</span></tt> or a higher number than 5.

Or you could just set their position to a fixed number with NO changes like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">enemy.position.y = 500;</span></tt>",,,,
