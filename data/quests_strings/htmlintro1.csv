HTMLINTRO1_3,"Before I explain anything, let's get you looking at the guts of a web page.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_4,"The page should open for you, but if it doesn't, you can try running Chrome...",riley,,,

HTMLINTRO1_14,"Awesome! You just edited a webpage, so that makes you a web designer!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_15,"Let's take it one step further - see the `<p>`, `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags in the code? Try changing the text between some of those tags...",riley,,,
