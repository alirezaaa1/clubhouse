HTMLINTRO1_1,"Hi, *{{user_name}}*! I know you've used the internet before - but have you ever wondered what goes into showing you all those web pages?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_2,"I was wondering that, one day, and I decided to go find out. There was a ton to learn, but now that I've done the legwork, I can pass it on to you.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_3,"Before I explain anything, let's get you looking at the guts of a web page.",,,,
HTMLINTRO1_4,"The page should open for you, but if it doesn't, you can try running Chrome...",,,,
HTMLINTRO1_5,Or you can click this link - https://codepen.io/madetohack/pen/BaaNeXj?editors=1000#code-area,,,,
HTMLINTRO1_6,OK! Here we are. The left-hand side of the page is showing you the code that the page is written in...,,,,
HTMLINTRO1_7,...And the right side is the page that you'd see if you found the page on the internet.,,,,
HTMLINTRO1_8,"So, you can see that, just like computer programs, web pages are written in a form of code - It's called HTML, which stands for (get ready, it's a whopper)...",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_9,*HyperText Markup Language*,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_10,"That sounds complicated, but (trust me!) it's not that bad. Hypertext is a word that describes text that can link to other text.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_11,You already know how that works since you've clicked links before. You were practically born knowing it!,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_12,Markup Language is the way you describe a set of codewords that you stick around text to show the computer how to display them.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_13,"So it's not that bad, actually.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_14,Let's take a look at some actual HTML! Click this link: https://codepen.io/madetohack/pen/BaaNeXj?editors=1000#code-area,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_15,"OK, here you are - if you want to revert all your changes, you can just refresh the page in your browser and it'll go back like this.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_16,Check out the text in the left-hand part of the window - that's the HTML code. I've put a TON of comments in to explain what all the parts do.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_17,"In HTML, everything with `<` and `>` around it is called a *tag*. Tags tell the browser how to display something - text, images, whatever.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_18,"Tags usually come in pairs - an `<opening tag>`, and a `</closing tag>`, like saying *start* and *stop*",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_19,"Let's get our hands dirty! Find the text *Hello, World!* on the page, and change it. Add you name, your favorite food, whatever you like.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_20,"Awesome! You just edited a webpage, so that makes you a web designer!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_21,"Let's take it one step further - see the <p>, <h1> and <h2> tags in the code? Try changing the text between some of those tags...",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_END,Nice job! I hope you're starting to see that HTML isn't quite as confusing as it seems. Come back for the next activity and we'll go deeper!,riley,,,
