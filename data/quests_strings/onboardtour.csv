ONBOARDTOUR_QUEST_SUBTITLE,Welcome to Endless OS!,,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Everything you need to get started with EOS is here - come on, dive in!",,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_ABORT,"OK, we'll stop for now. If you ever need to get back, though, you can &lt;HOW TO INVOKE HELP ON DEMAND&gt;",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_GREET1,"Hey there, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Welcome to Endless OS! I'm &lt;DOOD, THE PRINNY&gt;. First things first - Whenever you see a box like this, click the <b>‚ùØ</b> button to move to the next message.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_GREET2,"If you want to leave this tour, use the <b>X</b> button in the upper right of this text box. ",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_GREET3,"Also, if this text box is getting in the way, you can move it with the little arrow button just above this text.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_Q_FIRSTCOMP,"Let's get going! Is this your first computer, <b>{{user_name}}</b>?",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_ISFIRSTCOMP,Congratulations!,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_NOTFIRSTCOMP,"OK, you already know a thing or two, then. Great!",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_Q_PREVOS,"Since you've used other computers before, do you want me to explain how Endless OS differs from other OSes, or do you just want the basics?",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_A_PREVIOUS,How it's different,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_A_FRESH,Just the basics,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_Q_WHICHOS,"OK, I'll try and give you examples based on the computer your previously used. By the way, which kind was it? Pick the answer that matches the most familliar logo.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_STARTFRESH,"We'll start fresh, then.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_A_WIN,Windows (Microsoft),dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_A_MAC,macOS (Apple),dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_PICKEDWIN,"Alright, I'll try to explain Endless OS by how it's similar to Windows.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_PICKEDMAC,"Alright, I'll try to explain Endless OS by how it's similar to macOS.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KBM1,"Since this is your first computer, we need to talk a little about the hardware, so that you'll understand later if a program or tutorial tells you to ""Press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> + <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Alt</span></tt> + <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">P</span></tt> to open the command palette."", or something like that. ",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MOUSE1,"You've already figured out the basics of your mouse, since you're clicking on things on the screen! There are a few details and terms you should know, though.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MOUSE2,"The little arrow on the screen is called the <b>cursor</b> - so if any instructions talk about moving the cursor somewhere, that means move your mouse so that the arrow on the screen goes there.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MOUSE_DESK1,"Your mouse usually has two buttons, <b>left</b> and <b>right</b>, and might also have a <b>scroll wheel</b> in the center.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MOUSE_DESK2,"When something tells you to <b>click</b>, press the left mouse button down once. When something tells you to <b>right-click</b>, press the right mouse button. The right button is usually used for opening menus or lists of options.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MOUSE_DESK3,"You can spin the wheel in the center of your mouse up and down to move the screen up and down when there's more than one screen of information in a program.
Some mice even let you press the wheel into the mouse and use it as a third button, known as the <b>middle mouse button</b>. It's rarely used, and your mouse might not have one.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MOUSE_LAP1,"Laptops usually have a <b>touchpad mouse</b> also just called a <b>touchpad</b>. It can have buttons, or it might just have areas drawn on its surface that let you <b>left-click</b> and <b>right-click</b>.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MOUSE_LAP2,"If you don't have actual buttons on your touchpad, <b>clicking</b> means tapping on the touchpad, or pressing down until you hear a ""click."" When something tells you to <b>right-click</b>, you might have to press down with two fingers at once on the touchpad, or press the side of the touchpad - there are a few different ways your might work.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_MOUSE_LAP3,Some touchpads support swiping with two fingers to scroll windows up and down. Try yours out and see!,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KB1,"Let's move on to the keyboard. You already know how to type all the normal keys, but in the future, you might need to type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + S</span></tt>, or <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + (some other key)</span></tt>.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KB2,"When something asks you to type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + S</span></tt>, that means press and hold <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> (pronounced as ""Control""), then press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">S</span></tt>, then release both keys. You can hold <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> as long as you need to, but if you hold the other key for very long, it will repeat the command.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KB3,"There are some other keys like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt>: There's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Alt</span></tt>, and the key between <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl</span></tt> and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Alt</span></tt>, which is usually called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Win</span></tt> or ""the <b>Windows</b> Key"". On most keyboards it looks like the <b>Windows</b> logo - A square made of 4 squares.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KB4,"You can use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Win</span></tt> to switch between apps, but I'll cover that more when we talk about apps.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KB_LAP1,"Normally, the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">F Keys</span></tt> (<b>F1-F12</b>) on the top of your keyboard let you do laptop-specific tasks like turning your network connection on and off, adjusting screen brightness, volume, and more. Check the little pictures on them for a better idea of what they do.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KB_LAP2,"Sometimes, though, you might need to use your <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Fn</span></tt> or <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Function</span></tt> key, in combination with those <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">F Keys</span></tt> (<b>F1-F12</b>) to do the special action. Check your computer's manual for more information, every computer is different.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KB_DESK,"Your keyboard might also have a square pad on the far right with a lot of numbers on it - this is usually called the <b>numpad</b> or <b>number pad</b>. These keys will type numbers if <b>Num Lock</b> is on (look for a little light at the top of the keyboard), and will act as arrow keys or other keys if it's off.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KBM_MOVEON,"Now that you;ve got a handle on the hardware, let's move on.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_DESKTOP1,"We'll begin with what you're looking at now - This is called the <b>Desktop</b>, it's where everything starts.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_DESKTOP2,"When you install Apps, they show up here - just like on your phone.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_DESKTOP_MAC,"This isn't like the desktop on a Mac - You can't put files here, it's more like an extended <b>Dock</b>, or the <b>Launchpad</b>.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_DESKTOP_WIN,"This isn't like the Windows Desktop - You can't put files here, only Apps.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_DOCS,"You can get to your files by opening <b>Files</b>. You've already got pre-made folders for <b>Documents</b>, <b>Music</b>, <b>Pictures</b>, <b>Videos</b>, and more.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_STARTMENU1,"You're probably used to using the <b>Start Menu</b> to launch programs, or search for files. In Endless OS, you can search your files and programs by typing what you're looking for into the <b>Search Bar</b>.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_STARTMENU2,"Every program you install goes on the Desktop - but if you want a more detailed view, you can open the <b>App Center</b> and click the <b>Installed</b> tab at the top.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_TRASH_WIN,"You also might be wondering where the Recycle Bin is - It's in <b>Files</b>, and it's called the <b>Trash</b>. It works the same way - you can recover files you've deleted, or empty it out.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SPOTLIGHT1,"You might be used to using Spotlight to search your files and applications -  In Endless OS, the <b>Search Bar</b> is what you use to search everything on your computer.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SPOTLIGHT2,"If you're looking for the <b>Applications folder</b>, you can open the <b>App Center</b> from the <b>Desktop</b>, and click the <b>Installed</b> tab at the top.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_TRASH_MAC,"If you're wondering where the Trash is, it's in <b>Files</b>. It works the same way - you can recover files you've deleted, or empty it out.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS1,"Now that you know the basics of the <b>Desktop</b>, let's talk about <b>Apps</b> and <b>files</b>!",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS2,<b>Apps</b> are how you run programs on Endless OS - we use a system called <b>Flatpak</b> that lets you download and install everything from a central location.,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_HASNET,"Because you're connected to the internet, you can use the <b>App Center</b> to install new apps. ",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_Q_INSTALL,Do you want to quickly learn how to install apps with the <b>App Center</b>?,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_A_YES,Sure!,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_A_NO,"Not now, thanks.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_INSTALL1,"Great! OK, open up the <b>App Center</b> on the <b>Desktop</b>.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_INSTALL2,Click the little magnifying glass in the upper left - the <b>Search</b> button.,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_INSTALL3,"Search for <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Frozen Bubble</span></tt> - you should only get one result.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_INSTALL4,"Click on <b>Frozen Bubble</b>, then click <b>Download</b>, and wait for the progress bar to fill.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_INSTALL5,"Great! <b>Frozen Bubble</b> is installed - you can click <b>Launch</b> to start it from here, or run it from the <b>Desktop</b>.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_INSTALL6,"If you like, you can play a few rounds now - just press <b>‚ùØ</b> when you're ready to move on.",,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_NOINSTALL,"No problem, you can always open the <b>App Center</b> later and try.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPS_NONET,"You can't install any new apps if you're not connected to the internet, but you can still use the <b>App Center</b> to check what's already here for you to use.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_OPENWRITER,"OK, let's run an <b>App</b> right now - Find <b>LibreOffice Writer</b> on the <b>Desktop</b>, and click on it to launch it.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_TYPE,"Type some text - whatever you like, it's not important for this demo.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_TYPE_MOVEBOX,"For the next few steps, we'll need to use controls in the upper-right of the screen, where this text box is. To move this text box, move your cursor just above the first sentence in this text box, and click the little arrow that shows up. That moves this box to the bottom of the screen.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_FILE,"Next, move your cursor into the upper-left part of the screen and click on the <b>File</b> menu.
Then, move your cursor down the menu to <b>Save</b>, and click that.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SAVEDIALOG,"A new window will pop up. Type whatever you like in the <b>Name</b> space at the top, then click the blue <b>Save</b> button, or press <b>Enter</b> on your keyboard. Don't worry about where you saved your file, yet - we'll get to that soon.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_CLOSE,"Now, let's close <b>LibreOffice Writer</b> by clicking the <b>X</b> in the upper right-hand corner of the <b>LibreOffice Writer</b> window. ",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_CLOSE_WIN,Closing a program works the same way in Endless OS and Windows - closing the window closes the program.,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_CLOSE_MAC,"On a Mac, if you close a window, the program stays running. Here, on Endless OS, if you close the window, it closes the entire program.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_APPUSED,Great job! You successfully used an App!,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_FILES,"OK, now let's find that file you just saved.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_OPENFILES,"Find <b>Files</b> on the <b>Desktop</b>, and <b>click</b> to open it.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_GOTODOCS,"Now we can see all your files! You might remember that when we saved our file in <b>LibreOffice Writer</b>, it went to a folder called <b>Documents</b>. 
You can go into <b>Documents</b> by finding it in the main part of the window and <b>double-clicking</b> it, or by looking on the left side of the window, and <b>clicking</b> on it in the sidebar.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_THEREITIS,"And now that we're inside <b>Documents</b>, look, there's your file!",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SAVEAS1,<b>Double-click</b> on the file to open it in <b>LibreOffice</b> again.,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SAVEAS2,"What if you wanted to save this file on a USB stick, or in a specfic place?",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SAVEAS3,"Move your cursor into the upper-left part of the screen and click on the <b>File</b> menu.
Then, move your cursor down the menu to <b>Save As...</b>, and click that.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SAVEAS4,"This looks a lot like the <b>Save</b> menu you just saw, but now it should look more familliar... It's very close to the <b>Files</b> window that you just used!",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SAVEAS5,"You can move to different places on the computer's hard drive using the left sidebar - if you had another USB stick plugged in, for example, that's where it would show up.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SAVEAS6,"OK, you can click <b>Cancel</b>, and close <b>LibreOffice</b> again, using the <b>X</b> in the upper-right.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_CLOSEFILES,"There's another way you can find files, too. First, if <b>Files</b> is still open, close it by clicking the <b>X</b> in the upper-right corner. ",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_FINDBYNAME,Let's pretend you saved a file but didn't remember anything other than part of the name you used. This is where the <b>Search Bar</b> comes in handy. Type your file name in the <b>Search Bar</b>.,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_RESULTS,"Hopefully, you'll see just one entry in the results - that's your file! You might see more than one, but you can usually use the location below the name to figure out if it's the one you're looking for.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_OPENAGAIN,"You can click your file in the results list to open it, and now you can edit it again!",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SEARCHMORE,"You can search more than just files with the <b>Search Bar</b>, too. It can search the <b>Encyclopedia</b> App, and if you're connected to the internet, it can do a web search for you as well.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SEARCHWEB1,"Since you're connected to the internet, let's try that out. Let's see if ""breadfruit"" is a real thing!",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SEARCHWEB2,"Wow, it is. Look at all that info!",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SWITCHAPPS1,"What if you have a couple different Apps open at the same time and want to swtich between them? That can get a little comfusing, but EOS has some great features to help.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SWITCHAPPS2,"First, you can look at the left side of the bottom panel. The Apps that are open will show up there, with little dots underneath their icons. You can click the icon to switch to an app.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SWITCHAPPS3,"The keyboard can help you get to the <b>Desktop</b> quickly, like if you needed to open another app, or search for a file. Press the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Win</span></tt> key to show the desktop, and press it again to return to what you were doing.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SWITCHAPPS4,"You can also use the keyboard to switch between apps. Hold <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Win</span></tt> and tap <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Tab</span></tt> repeatedly to cycle through all the apps you have open - <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Alt</span></tt> + <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Tab</span></tt> does the same thing.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_Q_KNOWMORE,"Wow, I know this is all a lot! If you want to keep going, I have a few more things I can tell you about - but I understand if you're feeling a little overwhelmed.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_A_HACK,What's Hack?,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_A_HOW,How do I...,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_A_PROGRESS,‚ùØ,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_HOWDOI,&lt;Placeholder for howtos&gt;,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_WHATSHACK,"Don't worry, your computer hasn't been hacked! Hack is a toolset where a bunch of our characters guide you through learning programming, 2d art, 3d modeling, music creation, web design, and more! Some of Hack does require an internet connection, but not all of it - each activity is marked according to its needs.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_KEEPGOING,"OK, let's keep going!",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS1,"Now, even though Endless OS is set up to work great by default, it can help to know just a little about its inner workings. Let me show you the <b>Settings</b> window!",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS2,"The <b>Settings</b> window is how you control all the more detailed parts of Endless OS. It's important to know about, just in case.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS_TRAYICONS,Look in the bottom right corner of your screen - Do you see the icons to the left of the date and time? These icons are shortcuts for important information about your computer.,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS_MOVEWIN,"Also, if this text box is still in the bottom-right of the screen, you probably want to move it again - Just use the little arrow right on top of the first sentence, like last time!",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS_HASNET,"The icon on the left, the fan-shaped one, shows the strength of your connection to a Wi-Fi network - it's like the ""bars"" on your phone.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS_NONET,"The left-most icon might look like a fan with a little X on it, or an airplane - either way, it means you're not connected to a Wi-Fi network.
(The airplane means ""airplane mode"" - all wireless connections turned off.)",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS_TRAY_VOL,"The icon that looks like a little speaker gives you an idea of how loud your volume is. If you see a little X on it, that means your speakers or headphones are muted!",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS_LAP_BATT,"You'll also see a little icon that looks like a battery, and I think you can guess what that one means.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS_TRAY_INFO,You can click on any of these icons to get more detailed information about them.,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS8,"On the far right, in the corner, is a <b>circle</b> that has some letters in it - they're based off the name you typed in back when you set up Endless OS.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS9,"<b>Click</b> the <b>circle</b>, and a menu will pop up. Then. <b>click</b> the entry in the menu named <b>Settings</b>.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS10,"On the left side of the <b>Settings</b> window is a scrolling list of all the different things you can change - I know there are a lot, but you'll usually only need a few of them.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS11,"Some of the ones you might be interested in are visible already: <b>Wi-Fi</b>, <b>Background</b>, and <b>Power</b>.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS12,"<b>Wi-Fi</b> controls your network connection, useful if you're trying to connect to a specific network, or trying to turn it off to save battery.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS13,"<b>Background</b> lets you set your desktop image to whatever you want. Change it, if you like!",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS14,<b>Power</b> lets you change when your computer goes to sleep.,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS_LAP_PWR,"Because you have a laptop, you can have your power settings change depending on whether your computer is plugged in or not. Very handy!",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_SETTINGS15,"Take a look at more of the settings if you want, but you shouldn't have to change anything! Endless OS is set up to work correctly right out of the box.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_UPDATES1,"One last thing you should know about - Updates. You're probably familliar with automatic updates, most devices get them.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_UPDATES2,"Here the Endless OS Foundation, we're always working to improve Endless OS. We regularly release updates for free to all of our users, all you need is an internet connection.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_UPDATES3,"Also, all the applications you install with the <b>App Center</b> are updated for free.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_UPDATES4,"Normally, automatic updates are turned <b>on</b>, so if you have an active internet connection, they'll download automatically in the background.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_UPDATES5,"If you're worried about how much data the updates might use, you can choose to update manually instead - look in the <b>Automatic Updates</b> section of <b>Settings</b>.",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_ENDING1,"Congratulations! I know that was a lot, thanks for staying all the way to the end!",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_ENDING2,You now should know how to use Endless OS for most basic tasks!,dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_ENDING3,"Explore all the apps that are already installed, and check out what you can do with them. There's a ton to do!",dood,,,
ONBOARDTOUR_ENDING4,I hope you have fun with Endless OS - See you around!,dood,,,
