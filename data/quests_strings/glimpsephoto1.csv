GLIMPSEPHOTO1_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"In this activity, you'll learn to remove blemishes, adjust light exposure and color saturation, and crop a picture.",,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_1,"Have you ever taken a picture and wished it looked a little better? It's time to learn how computers can improve your photos! First off, open Glimpse.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_2,"Glimpse is a photo editing program with a ton of neat tools - a lot like Photoshop! Today, we're going to learn some of the basic tools that can make a big difference.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_3,"Let's open up our example photo. Go to File &lt; Open, and then, using the file browser that opens up, go to your <b>home</b> directory (it's got your username on it, on the left side of the file browser). Once you're there, navigate into your <b>Pictures</b> folder, then into <b>GlimpseSources</b>, where you'll find <b>lower-face.jpg</b>.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_4,"Once we have the photo pulled up, we can start making changes. The first thing you might notice is that this person has some blemishes, or small unsightly marks. We're going to make them disappear! Look for a tool icon of two band-aids making an X.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_5,"It's called the Healing tool, and it's near the bottom right of the tool collection. Once you've clicked on it, you're ready to start using it. But this one is tricky, so you can't just click on the blemish you want to erase.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_6,"First, we have to ctrl+click on a part of the picture we want to copy, and then we click on the blemish. It will make the area of the blemish look similar to wherever you clicked first.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_7,"So, hold the ctrl key and click on a part of the skin near what you want to erase. (This will help it look natural.) Then you can use a regular click to cover the trouble spot with your saved sample.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_8,"And ya know, I usually use this technique when I want to make a nice photograph. But sometimes, I get a little silly and ctrl+click an odd area like hair or teeth. Try it and see what happens! Remember you can always Undo from the Edit menu.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_9,"All right, I'm going to assume you have your photo looking the way you want it...",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_10,"Next let's talk about <b>exposure</b>. In film cameras, this refers to how long the lens stays open to let light hit the film, which will hold the image. The longer the <b>exposure</b>, the lighter and brighter the image. The shorter it is, the more shadows you'll see.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_11,"Once upon a time, this couldn't be changed once a photo was taken. Now, with programs like Glimpse, you can make it look like the film was ""exposed"" for a different amount of time. Go to the Colors menu, then select Exposure. ",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_12,"Now you can increase or decrease the amount of shadow, or Black, by dragging the slider left and right. Same thing for light, or <b>Exposure</b>. If you want to see half the photo unchanged for comparison, check the ""Split view"" box in the lower right.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_13,"As you may have noticed, the whole image is changed once you hit OK. The Reset button will undo the changes you've made and put the settings back to where they started.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_14,"Excellent! You've already made some noticeable changes to this photo. Now we're going to adjust it a little more, by tweaking the <b>color saturation</b>. This refers to how bright and vivid the colors are.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_15,"You've probably seen a photo with colors so bright they looked unnatural, or maybe they hurt your eyes. That picture was probably <b>oversaturated</b>. On the flip side, maybe you've seen a photo that looked a little washed out or colorless. It was most likely <b>undersaturated</b>.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_16,"Use the menus to go to Colors &lt; Saturation. Try dragging the slider or clicking within the bar. You have the option for a Split view here as well. Any time you aren't sure what an adjustment slider does, it's a good idea to try both ends of it.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_17,"You may have already noticed this, but if you take the color saturation away completely, it's a black and white photo. This can be nice when you want a different look. All right, are you ready for the next one? You're doing great so far!",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_18,"Next, we're going to <b>crop</b> a photo. When film cameras were the only ones available, cropping had to be done by hand with a small sharp knife. And you couldn't undo any mistakes! Nowadays, we can use tools like this instead. Thank goodness!",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_19,"If your photo has something you don't like in it, or you want to focus more on a specific part, this is really helpful. Select the <b>Crop</b> tool. It's on the right side of the tool collection, in the second row. It looks like two framing corners coming together.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_20,"Now you just click and drag to create a box. The inside of the box will be the new photo, but don't worry if it didn't come out like you expected. You might notice that the rest of the photo still seems to be there, just a bit darker...",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_21,"That's because we haven't actually cropped it yet, we just told the computer where we WILL crop it. And we can change that by dragging the edges or corners of the box. If you move the mouse around inside that box, you'll see some boxes appearing.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_22,"These boxes show you where you can click to adjust the nearby edge or corner. With other programs, sometimes you have to get your mouse exactly on the outer line. That can be tricky for me. Click and drag until you like the look!",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_23,"Now, you might have noticed that there's a tiny icon of a sharp knife next to your cursor now. Remember how they used to cut photos to size? That's a little throwback. When you like the size and shape of your photo, you can press the enter key or click within your box.",daemon2,,,
GLIMPSEPHOTO1_24,"Now you're ready to save your photo and show it off to the world! And next time you have a photo of your own that needs some ""retouching,"" you'll know how to fix it up!",daemon2,,,
