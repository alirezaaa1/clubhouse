HTMLINTRO2_1,"Hey again! This lesson's going to go a little deeper, *{{user_name}}*...",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_2,First things first - let's get back to that web page previewer.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_3,"If it's not opening, run or switch to Chrome. You can hold *Alt* and press *Tab* to cycle through active programs, or look at the bottom of the screen.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_4,... Or you can click this link: https://codepen.io/madetohack/pen/BaaKggj?editors=1000,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_5,"Here's a fun fact - Just based on our last lesson, you already know enough to make your own webpage!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_6,"If you did, though, all you'd have is boring black text on a white background. Let's spice that up a little...",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_7,"Find an opening *<p>* tag in your code, and add this after the *p* - *style=”color:blue”*",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_8,"If you did it correctly, the tag will look like this *<p style=""color:blue"">*, and your text will be blue!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_9,Congratulations! You just *styled* some text! Now let's get even fancier.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_10,"Find another *<p>* tag and make *that* text orange, or red.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_11,I wonder what happens if you try the same logic with an *<h1>* or *<h2>* tag? Try making one of those purple.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_12,"If you did it right, it should look something like *<h1 style=""color:purple"">*.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_13,Nice. But what if you wanted to use that shade of green that grass gets when it's almost summer but not quite?,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_14,"That's probably not a color your web browser understands, so we need a more specific way to express color.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_15,"Fortunately, your web brower understands something called *hex color* - a way of expressing color using 6-digit numbers.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_16,Here's an example hex color - *#76EECF*,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_17,"Notice the letters in there - Hex color uses 1 to 9, then A B C D E F. Think of it as a way of getting 2 digit numbers without using 2 digits.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_18,"The 3 groups of 2 numbers express how much red, green, and blue you need to make that color.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_19,"*#76EECF* means some red, *lots* of green, and a good amount of blue..",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_20,"To use a hex color in your webpage, just replace one of your color words with a hex code - try *#76EECF*!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_21,"If you edited a *<p>* tag, it would be *<p style=""color:#76EECF"">*",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_22,Cool! Try another color!,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_23,"If you don't want to just guess at color shades, you can try this webpage: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_END,Nice job! Now you've got the tools to paint the whole internet! See you soon!,riley,,,
