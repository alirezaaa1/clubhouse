P5JSVARINTRO3_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"In part 3 of this activity, it's time to tie it all together and control the randomness with your mouse.",,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_1,Yay! You're back! I'm so excited to show you the last part to this activity!,daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_2,"Let's get back to the p5.js code editor. You can load your previous sketch (if you saved it at <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">http://editor.p5js.org),</span></u> or click this link to get back to where we left off: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://editor.p5js.org/madetohack/sketches/PwEfO7Hl</span></u>",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_3,"From our last sketch, we should see a square that randomly flashes colors. But what if we wanted to see the square only when we click?",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_4,"So, <b>p5.js</b> has a lot of built in cool properties. One of these is called <b>mouseIsPressed()</b>. This property lets you bring interactivity into your sketches, by telling your code to do something when the mouse is clicked, or not clicked",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_5,"Under stroke(r, g, b); at line 13, go ahead create a new line and type 'if (mouseIsPressed === true) {'. The reason we are using true here is because with the property <b>mouseIsPressed()</b> it is either clicked or not clicked. When we have <b>mouseIsPressed</b> set to true, we are telling our code that when the mouse is clicked do the task we are telling it to do. When it is set to false, we are telling it to stop doing the task when the mouse is clicked. ",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_6,"Also, just like how setup() and draw() is a function, so is <b>mouseIsPressed()</b>. That is why it is important to include ""curly braces ( {} )"" when you use <b>mouseIsPressed()</b>.",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_7,"Now that we understand <b>mouseIsPressed()</b> a little more, let's keep going. ",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_8,"Since we want the square to activate when we click the mouse, go to line 15 and create a new line and type '}' to close the <b>mouseIsPressed()</b>. This is now letting<b>mouseIsPressed()</b> to do the thing inside of the ""curly braces ( {} )"", which is draw our square.  ",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_9,Now go ahead and play your sketch! You'll notice the square only follows your mouse when you click it. ,daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_10,"Try and see what happens when you set the <b>mouseIsPressed()</b> to false. You can do this by delete the true on line 13 and typing 'false' in its place. Now, when the mouse is clicked we are telling the function to stop the square from being created. ",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_11,"To add the final touches on this sketch, change the false back to true on line 13. And I also wonder if it's possible to make our drawing stay on our canvas instead of disappearing right away.  
",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_12,I think I know! And if you played with <b>p5.js</b> previously you might of guessed it too. ,daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_13,"If you delete background(220); from the function draw(); and type 'background(220);' in function setup(); just below createCanvas(); on line 3, we might get what we're going for. ",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_14,"Go ahead and play the sketch and see what happens! You should be able to click and the square stays now.  
",daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_15,Yay! This is so much fun! It's like we made our own drawing application! Amazing job!,daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_16,Try experimenting with the code and changing the color ranges or the background to see what you can create!,daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_17,Remember you can save your creations by taking a screenshot by pressing the 'print screen' on your keyboard. Your image should show up in your Pictures folder.,daemon3,,,
P5JSVARINTRO3_18,You're really becoming a pro with <b>p5.js</b>! I can't wait to see what we make in the future.,daemon3,,,
