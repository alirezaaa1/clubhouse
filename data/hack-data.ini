# This blacklist is for apps that are released along with the core OS; Flatpak
# apps that we don't control; and Flatpak apps that we do control that cannot be
# set to NoDisplay=true. It should only be used as a last resort; basically any
# app with NoDisplay=false should be hackable.

# This whitelist is for apps that are explicitly supposed to be hackable in
# Episode 1. It's only temporary, as the general idea is that everything should
# be hackable all the time.
# If the whitelist is empty or not present, then it will be ignored and all apps
# not in the blacklist will once again be hackable.
